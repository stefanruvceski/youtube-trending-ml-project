Just about everyone knows of the Mazda Miata and the RX-7, but what about the tiny car Mazda made that has a huge following in the car community? Japan has variable taxes on vehicles based on their displacement, hence why manufacturers started making tiny cars called Kei cars. Just because they are tiny does not mean they are lame, Suzuki made the Cappuccino, Honda made the Beat, and Mazda made one of the coolest Kei cars ever, the Mazda Autozam AZ-1. The Autozam has super car features like the super rad gull-wing doors and even more interesting is the story of how the autozam came to be.

This test, which does not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, is intended to demonstrate Crew Dragon’s ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. The six-hour test window opens at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC. A backup opportunity with the same six-hour launch window opening at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC, is available on Monday, January 20. Current weather data suggests our best opportunity for the launch escape test will be towards the end of the four-hour window, but we will continue to provide updates as new data becomes available."

One night, he makes the mistake of drunkenly dropping an inflammatory barb on a broadcast of Skizm, an illegal death-match fight club streamed live to the public. In response, Riktor (Ned Dennehy), the maniacal mastermind behind the channel, decides to force Miles' hand (or hands, as it were) and have him join the fun. Miles wakes to find heavy pistols bolted into his bones, and learns Nix (Samara Weaving), the trigger-happy star of Skizm, is his first opponent. Gleefully echoing elements of Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the Purge franchise, and videogames like Mortal Kombat, Guns Akimbo is hilariously dark, viciously violent, and potentially — chillingly — prescient. Director Jason Lei Howden (Deathgasm) foretells of a future that may soon await us: drone-captured live feeds, UFC-like competitions pushed to an extreme, and online streaming platforms used for gladiatorial entertainment all around the world. As Miles navigates the underworld of Skizm, the stakes — and the ratings — have never been higher. #GunsAkimbo #DanielRadcliffe #SamaraWeavingIn Cinemas March 5th 2020Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/madmanfilmsTwitter: http://twitter.com/madmanfilms Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/madmanfilms"

The planet, called TOI 1338b, is around 6.9 times larger than Earth, or between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn. It lies in a system 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Pictor.The stars in the system make an eclipsing binary, which occurs when the stellar companions circle each other in our plane of view. One is about 10% more massive than our Sun, while the other is cooler, dimmer and only one-third the Sun’s mass. TOI 1338b’s transits are irregular, between every 93 and 95 days, and vary in depth and duration thanks to the orbital motion of its stars. TESS only sees the transits crossing the larger star — the transits of the smaller star are too faint to detect. Although the planet transits irregularly, its orbit is stable for at least the next 10 million years. The orbit’s angle to us, however, changes enough that the planet transit will cease after November 2023 and resume eight years later.Read more: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-mission-uncovers-its-1st-world-with-two-stars Music: Albatross from Universal Production Music.Video credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight CenterChris Smith (USRA): Lead ProducerChris Smith (USRA): Lead AnimatorJeanette Kazmierczak (University of Maryland College Park): Lead Science WriterChris Smith (USRA): WriterVeselin Kostov (NASA Postdoctoral Fellow): ScientistThis video is public domain and along with other supporting visualizations can be downloaded from NASA Goddard's Scientific Visualization Studio at: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13510If you liked this video, subscribe to the NASA Goddard YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/NASAGoddardFollow NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center· Instagram http://www.instagram.com/nasagoddard· Twitter http://twitter.com/NASAGoddard· Twitter http://twitter.com/NASAGoddardPix· Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/NASAGoddard· Flickr http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc"

Rick Shiels heads to the Quest Golf Academy to test the drivers and see if they do actually hit the golf ball longer, hit the golf ball straight and help swing the golf club faster. Rick tests the driver using Titleist PRO V1 golf balls and Foresight GC Quad. Rick then takes the Callaway Mavrik Driver on the course against the Callaway Epic Flash Driver from 2019 to see if the claim of gaining 5 more yards is actually true. The Callaway Mavrik Driver, Callaway Mavrik Subzero Driver and Callaway Mavrik Max Driver will be played by golfers on The European Tour, The PGA Tour as well as The Masters, The USPGA, The US Open and The Open. Some of the best golfers in the world such as Phil Mickelson, Xander Schauffelle, Danny Willett, Francesco Molinari and Henrik Stenson will be using the new drivers BUT are they actually any better than the Callaway Epic Flash?

I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs.
