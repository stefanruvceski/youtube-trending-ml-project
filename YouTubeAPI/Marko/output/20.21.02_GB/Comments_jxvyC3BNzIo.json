It was a really tough time for me and felt hopeless. I never wanted to cry because it made me feel weak and I also avoided looking at old photos and stuff so I wouldn&#39;t.

I had been living in complete fear for 3 years and that really hit me like a bus. 5 days later the time halved and every day it just got shorter and shorter to the point that it got from 1 year to 3 days over the span of a month.
