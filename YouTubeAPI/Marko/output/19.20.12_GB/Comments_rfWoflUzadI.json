This movie (cut down and in part) could have been the 8th episode in place Last Jedi and instead of Last Jedi telling Rey she has no parents, you end the 8th episode with the bombshell that she is a Palpatine and that she actually considered joining Kylo (mirroring a 'ben why didn't you tell me' reveal of Luke's parentage). This would have actually given Rey character and a arc in episode 8. Especially if she is good at dark side powers but not at light side. They could have even explored more of Rey trying to choose the light (while being born from a Sith) and Kylo trying to choose dark side while having being born in the light. You could develop more about Finn and the storm trooper brainwashing and Finn and group in Episode8 destroy the brainwashing center and you get some stormtroopers joining Finn and hell, I would be totally fine with Rey being so confused and lost at learning she is a Palpatine that she JOINS Kylo and the first order in Episode 8. A dark side Rey and Kylo at the end of 8, with Leia and the others stuck on the other side would setup a lot of tension and character development. Then in a real episode 9, you could have Palpatine return, develop everything into the final confrontation and it could make some sense. You could even explain that Luke was in hiding because he sensed Palpatine or whatever and that he was actively investigating and doing 'something' but that his attempt to stop Palpatine resulted in losing Kylo, and then he lost Rey and so he has to go with the Leia, and the others to save their 'kids'. Instead we have Episode 8 destroyed Episode 7 and Episode 9 ignored 8 ever existed.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-20T19:29:00.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-20T19:29:00.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/IjAKzeNXVvNoGHr7pLLXxsw272E\"", "id": "UgzwMS4gfEQei6fsqQx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rfWoflUzadI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/X6uoQehW-oqsbLDnLjfL4Pe0BsI\"", "id": "UgzwMS4gfEQei6fsqQx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "crlwgr", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79ce7kcrrD23QIIwezLFAa--CM1-3CC-WEvEw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3UmEdI9fkDb6RnsTA8RGNA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3UmEdI9fkDb6RnsTA8RGNA"}, "videoId": "rfWoflUzadI", "textDisplay": "Thanks man.
