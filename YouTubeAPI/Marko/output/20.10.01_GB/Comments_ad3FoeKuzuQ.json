I think there are people that consider themselves &quot;royalists&quot; over here but are in fact just nasty backward thinking people with no brain cells. Harry quite clearly is still suffering with the events surrounding his mothers death and the way he, William and his mother were hounded by the press - it is understandable that he wants to escape this and take his family to a safer, purer, environment. I think the issue some people have with Meghan is she was something different and wasn&#39;t prepared enough for Royal life. It&#39;s not something you can adjust to overnight. Do I think they married too quickly? Yes, I do. I think they should have considered the fact our press can be nasty, our press are invasive - because they are. However if it felt right for them, then that&#39;s their decision. Is it because Meghan is a black woman? Partly. I know this may be hard to believe considering the racism in states, but over here it&#39;s not really a &quot;black &amp; white&quot;  thing like in the USA, it&#39;s more a xenophobic &quot;white &amp; muslim&quot; thing - which obviously is still absolutely abhorrent and there is no excuse for racism or xenophobia. Yes, some people are bothered by the fact she is mixed race, but it&#39;s a VERY minor percentage, it&#39;s primarily down to the way she&#39;s conducted herself (which has at times gone against protocol) and the fact she&#39;s obviously made Harry a more independent man and the &quot;royalists&quot; can&#39;t stand that. The press have indeed tried to make it a racial issue but are failing because it honestly doesn&#39;t come down to her race, it&#39;s more her personality, her &quot;motives&quot; as some are ridiculously presuming. There are people that don&#39;t like the fact she&#39;s a very ordinary woman from a very ordinary background from a different country, that&#39;s managed to capture the heart of the beloved Prince. People also don&#39;t like a strong woman with her own mind, her own path etc and Meghan has exactly that - she&#39;s a strong woman.

I am of the view not looking at it from the sense of responsibility that one is to carry as a royal family member but from that as a normal individual. I would like to state once more that everything I am about to say is of my own personal view. I think that as one takes a new step in life there is always a new level of responsibility, expectations and more tasks to balance depending on your occupation or role in society. Sometimes the amount of things that a person would have to do can be stressful or really hard to manage and even though another person may be able to handle the position or that stress with ease I believe that not everyone can juggle so many things or due to who you are as an individual, it causes you to be unable to meet certain standards or agree to certain expectations. It is for this same reason that persons may decide to change professions or be happy helping in society but from a different angle such as household workers, sanitation workers and a speech writer who may be shy to have the responsibility of giving a speech but can still be of use for writing a killer essay or piece. Hence, I believe that view can be given that Megan has come from a normal upbringing and is accustomed to being expressive as Jeannie had said that she used be active on her Instagram and probably other social media outlets, was able to have fun with friends and go to alot of different locations and enjoy different outfits and was free to Express herself. Therefore, to then go into the royal family where everything about herself and personality is drastically stripped away she could be feeling as if she has no freedom to be the individual that she is and may be of the view that everything she has loved has been stripped away such as the freedom of expression on social media, doing the activities and vlogs that she may have loved to do, the freedom to wear whatever she wants, the freedom to hang out with friends who motivate and inspire you and anyone can correct me if I am wrong but the royals are not seen walking around all of the time and may not travel every where providing that there may be many attempts at their lives. It should be considered that things happen behind closed curtains beyond the public eye and the fact that Megan is being honest about not being able to meet the expectations and balance those extra tasks then there should be no bashing or problem with honesty, just find a way to make things either more easier to manage, find a way to split responsibilities or give the task to someone in the royal family that can handle it. Hence I would say to not only look at it from the Queens perspective and with the view that Megan must conform to the expectation  of other members of the royal family or of us the public but the concern should be her mental health and making sure that she is true to herself. My views being said and having come to an end I would say though however, that where a mistake could have been made in that a proper channel could have been taken which was to discuss it among the royal family first before making a hasty statement to the public. Hence that being said we all as humans make mistakes and when emotional make adhoc moves and statements so I do not think that should be held against her. Also can you imagine being take away from your family to live only with persons that you do not know so well and not disrespecting her husband but ladies can be honest and do know that sometimes just the encouragement from your spouse may not always be affective in the way that the extra push from your family member, bestfriend or a person of the same sex would be and sometimes there are things that one might not feel comfortable discussing with a spouse.", "textOriginal": "It is my personal opinion as Loni had said that there are many traditions that have been prevalent over the years for the royal family.
