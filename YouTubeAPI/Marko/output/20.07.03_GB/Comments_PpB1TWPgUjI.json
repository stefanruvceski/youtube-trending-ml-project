He trusted I would accept and affirm him which is exactly what I did and it\u2019s brought us even closer and has made me a better person and mom.

The majority are senior pastors whose churches actually believe the lie that the LGBTQ community are going to hell.

AJ was immediately disowned by our entire family on both sides including his father after they found out he is gay. My mom also disowned and disinherited me when I refused to abandon my son or withdraw my support of the LGBTQ community. Unfortunately because AJ and I were living on family property and working in the family business we lost literally everything having to leave our home only with what we could physically carry off the property.  We didn\u2019t just loose items of value but irreplaceable keepsakes and mementos like family photos. My family refuses to return any of it! We would have been homeless if it wasn\u2019t for a generous, kind hearted friend who has become my chosen sister and AJ\u2019s Aunt. I wish I could say things got better but my mom and her husband began a hate campaign directed at AJ by sending the most vile, disgusting hate letters, texts and emails. I will never forget the sound of my grown son crying like a baby as he literally fell to the floor after reading just the first few lines. Yes, they really were that bad! My son is the kindest most compassionate young man you\u2019ve ever met and he adored his grandmother. Her rejection has caused scars that will last a lifetime. I knew my mom would never accept having a gay grandson but never in a million years did I dream she\u2019d be so hateful to AJ of all people. He was her favorite until she found out he\u2019s gay.  In January 2019 I was forced to call 911 after my brother-in-law and step-father broke into our home and physically assaulted my son while calling him ugly gay slurs and telling him he was going to hell.

Grieving the loss of loved ones who are still very much alive has been excruciatingly painful but we are both healing and doing much better.
