I want to edit it!! <br /><br />I was going to say: If you are experiencing negative emotional stress &amp; feeling isolated and indifferent, you need to go to a different place of worship. I keep seeing comments of people judging the entire religion based on that 1 community, theres 100,000s\u2019 many more out there. You cant base 1 horrible experience on the entire religion. That does not define everyone or the religion. People are so blind it\u2019s crazy how one-sides things can be. Some in the religion are more extreme than others, &amp; some are more helpful and supportive than others. A cult is run by a person &amp; made up based on a false religion coming from 1 person\u2019s form of beliefs. The JW\u2019s are a branch of Christianity and believe in Jesus, who is Gods son. They worship 1 GOD. They DO NOT worship a man. They read a PUBLISHED BIBLE. (Have you ever seen <b>Midsommar</b> that movie was great &amp; that movie is a CULT). <br /><br />I didnt read the description and its extremely sad, someone as yourself is posting something about a widespread religion because of something you\u2019re personally going through based on 1 teeny weeny part of the entire community. You have 2 million subscribers and im assuming you\u2019re an influencer? Of the sorts idk never heard of you until i saw an article on snapchat. You know what it said? \u201cAnti LGBT religious group\u201d  , JW\u2019s are not anti LGBT GROUP. They do not actively hate or hurt anyone. They dont go out in public or talk amongst themselves and hate talk anyone of such. They are not the KKK of LGBT. Now THAT IS a hate group. Just because you\u2019re father and family is treating you like that, you have no right being so blind and disrespectful to such religion. Where as you\u2019re influencing the negativity and not the positivity. Something the LGBT doesn\u2019t stand for, which is negativity. Just because you have a bad experience doesn\u2019t define the entirety of the JW\u2019s religion or who the people are. If a dog bites you, are you going to judge all dogs as malicious biters? No. You aren\u2019t. So why are you being so ignorant and insensitive to the JW group by posting such a crazy controversial video. You just had to talk about your feelings not go in entirely to the details of said religion. If you were Jewish and posting something like this you would probably be getting hate. JW\u2019s also got sent to camps by Hitler. JW\u2019s are like a branch of Jews. Did you know that? I hope you read this so you can see how bad you acted on the situation. That description is completely unnecessary. You\u2019re fighting hate and rejection and its one sided since JW\u2019s cannot defend themselves on the media. Its also very hypocritical of you. You\u2019re not the only one facing troubles right now. Your mom and father are as well. This video kinda shows how blind you are. What about his feelings? You know he is an elder and know how strict he is with his religious beliefs. ITS HIS BELIEF. Its who he is. Kind of how you\u2019re a lesbian. It goes both ways, not just 1. You both need to come to an understanding with each other and not just sit behind a camera and play victim. You took everything out of play by accusing the entire JW of such actions. Very selfish and a wrong thing to do. If anything thats sinister of you, considering someone who influences people. You\u2019re just fighting that rejection and putting your anger on millions of people who are JW\u2019s. Calling it a cult when a cult can barely grow past 100k people or even waaayy less than that.", "textOriginal": "Did she delete my comment?? I wrote a paragraph lol where is my comment I can\u2019t find it. I want to edit it!! \n\nI was going to say: If you are experiencing negative emotional stress & feeling isolated and indifferent, you need to go to a different place of worship. I keep seeing comments of people judging the entire religion based on that 1 community, theres 100,000s\u2019 many more out there. You cant base 1 horrible experience on the entire religion. That does not define everyone or the religion. People are so blind it\u2019s crazy how one-sides things can be. Some in the religion are more extreme than others, & some are more helpful and supportive than others. A cult is run by a person & made up based on a false religion coming from 1 person\u2019s form of beliefs. The JW\u2019s are a branch of Christianity and believe in Jesus, who is Gods son. They worship 1 GOD. They DO NOT worship a man. They read a PUBLISHED BIBLE. (Have you ever seen *Midsommar* that movie was great & that movie is a CULT). \n\nI didnt read the description and its extremely sad, someone as yourself is posting something about a widespread religion because of something you\u2019re personally going through based on 1 teeny weeny part of the entire community.
