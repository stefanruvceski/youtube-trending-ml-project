It definatley tried to appease the outraged fans, but I don&#39;t think it tries to completely retcon The Last Jedi. What happened in Episode 8 still happened as far as Episode 9 is concerned. Remember that Lukes force vision in Episode 8 uses Anakins lightsaber against Kylo Ren, the same one he throws over his shoulder at the start of the same movie. To me, thats a sign that he&#39;d already realised he was wrong about all the stuff that sent him to Anch-To. Though I agree that you can pretty much watch The Rise Of Skywalker without seeing The Last Jedi.<br /><br /><br />Just so people know, general audiences really like this film. Alot.

The Star Wars fan base has really taken a turn for the worst if they can't appreciate this film with all the fan service. Hell, the fans are so all over the place, they're saying the prequels are now good after years of bashing them. The Rise Of Skywalker was not the best one, but was far from the worst. It ended the saga well I think. As a fan of The Last Jedi (just my opinion), I think its a bit unfair to say that this one totally disregards the previous one. It definatley tried to appease the outraged fans, but I don't think it tries to completely retcon The Last Jedi. What happened in Episode 8 still happened as far as Episode 9 is concerned. Remember that Lukes force vision in Episode 8 uses Anakins lightsaber against Kylo Ren, the same one he throws over his shoulder at the start of the same movie. To me, thats a sign that he'd already realised he was wrong about all the stuff that sent him to Anch-To. Though I agree that you can pretty much watch The Rise Of Skywalker without seeing The Last Jedi.\n\n\nJust so people know, general audiences really like this film. Alot. Don't be fooled cos of all the negative reviews. People who have something to moan about shout the loudest.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-31T00:04:36.000Z", "updatedAt":
