Here I show you 5 lat exercises for getting a wider back by focusing on the lower lats. The key to getting sweeping lats is to not only train your back with the right exercises but by making sure you are performing them the right way.That said, if you want to build a wider back and lats you have to do two very important things in your back workouts. First, you must be willing to take the exercises you are doing through a full range of motion. Simply focusing on the middle portion of every row, pullup and pulldown is not going to give you fully developed lats just as doing this with your curls will give you fully developed biceps.Beyond that, if you don‚Äôt ever focus on creating a peak contraction of the lats by digging your elbow into your hip at the bottom of every rep, then you won‚Äôt get the muscle to grow as much as it is capable of. Each of the lat exercises shown here will help you to do exactly this. They will take your lats through a full range of motion and get you to place extra emphasis on the contracted position of the muscle.The first exercise shown is called the tripod underhand row. It is important to note that the grip makes all the difference in the effectiveness of this exercise in targeting the lats. When you perform it with an overhand grip you shift most of the focus of the move to the muscles of your upper back rather than the latissimus. When you switch to a supinated grip your elbow becomes much easier to tuck into your side, drive towards your pelvis and ultimately obtain a greater contraction of the lats in their fully shortened state.The second exercise is the wide grip underhand pulldown. This one actually helps those that struggle to feel what it should feel like to get your elbows driven into your hips. Because the movement starts with your elbows out wide, the only place for them to travel is down and in closer to your hips and pelvis. The underhand position once again helps to allow the elbows to ultimately get closer to your sides and increase the contraction of the lats.The rocking pulldown is another awesome back exercise for building wider lats because it adds the additional ability to get rotation of the torso as you drive your arm down into your side. Being able to focus on one side at a time helps those that struggle to feel a strong contraction in the lats even more.If ever there was a face pull for your lats, the high cable row would be it. This allows you once again to train one side at a time in a very athletic manner - by standing on your feet with the ability to include rotation for a v-taper back. This enables you to separate your hips from your shoulders by rotating them in opposite directions which really increases the stretch on your lats and allows for a more powerful contraction. Not just that, the up and away position of the arm creates an even more significant stretch on the lats attachments which tends to allow the user to feel a stronger contraction of the lats at the end of each rep.The incline single arm stretch pulldown is an amazing lat exercise for growing a wider back. This setup does require that you have access to an incline bench and a cable apparatus, but if you do, it‚Äôs worth the extra effort. Here you can get an amazing stretch on the lats by letting your arm drift high up overhead, with a clear target for your elbow to be driven down towards your hip on every rep. The contraction you should feel on this in your lower lats will be intense if performed correctly.Finally, there is no better lat exercise for building straight arm scapular strength than the straight arm pushdown. Performin the move one arm at a time as shown in the video. Look to not just get to the level of your back but past it to really increase the squeeze on the lower lats in the bottom position.All of these lat exercises are great for building a wider back and lats. You do not have to do all of them to get results. In fact, if you mix in one or two with your standard heavy rows, weighted pullups and deadlifts, you will notice a wider back in no time.

It‚Äôs now time to finally reach their dreams that are beautifully blooming.Furthermore, the title track, ‚ÄúFIESTA,‚Äù as the name implies, is expressed in a bold and glamorous manner through the image of ‚Äúfestivals,‚Äù depicting IZ*ONE as a group in their full bloom. If the strong passion of ‚ÄúLa Vie en Rose‚Äù met with the lovely ‚ÄúVioleta‚Äù to express the group‚Äôs radiant future, ‚ÄúFIESTA‚Äù represents the effort to make their once dreamed of future into reality. In order to shine light on this long-awaited moment, IZ*ONE has finally blossomed through magnificent colors. With genuine hopes to fulfill their dream, IZ*ONE aims to soar higher than ever with their first studio album [BLOOM*IZ].- IZ*ONE Official Twitter : https://twitter.com/official_izone- IZ*ONE Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/official.izone- IZ*ONE Official Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/official_izone- IZ*ONE Official fancafe : http://cafe.daum.net/official-izone#BLOOM_IZ #ÏïÑÏù¥Ï¶àÏõê #FIESTA"

Footage was really quite difficult to find, so hopefully you can forgive me playing a little visually loose with the truth.Also the Soviet space program was barely even mentioned in the video. I‚Äôve often thought it‚Äôs a bit sad that the Soviet Union got the first satellite into space, the first doggos (let‚Äôs not discuss it), the first man, the first woman, the first probe to the moon, the first spacewalk, and the first robot on another celestial body ‚Äì yet the winner‚Äôs medal generally goes to the US for reaching the moon, and doing it so brilliantly. (Which they did, and which it was.)Not in any way meaning to discredit the US here, I‚Äôd just like to urge you to spare a thought for those other clever men and women a continent away who were ‚Äì at the very same time ‚Äì also taking marvellous and brave strides into space. I‚Äôve had quite a fascination with the Apollo program over the years, and space in general. If it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre interested in too, here‚Äôs the stuff I really, really enjoyed reading and watching. (No one‚Äôs paying me for this, I just dig them.

Welcome to another episode of thrift store makeovers/thrift flips. I love hunting through thrift stores to find old, rejected items and then decorating them and putting my own style on them to turn them into new pieces of art. Today I decided to use an antique clutch (satchel lol) and I decorated it using leather paints. I hope you like bright, colorful designs, and butterflies! Also, bringing back the fruit theme so get ready for that.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.
