First off, I don&#39;t think it is that bad, but, I have major problems with it. First, the stupid goddamn jump-cuts to just push stuff along, if they had made the movie 15-20 minutes longer just to have some breathing room for the opening act, it would&#39;ve felt more... organic like you said in one of your reviews. Instead, it has too much, &quot;Here it is, PSYCH! Just kidding!&quot;, and I feel that took away from those moments that should&#39;ve been more impactful, but weren&#39;t because of the lack of time. So, a lot of the beginning for me was just, JUMP CUT, JUMP CUT, JUMP CUT, SABER FIGHT, JUMP CUT. That kinda threw me because i wanted more breathing room.<br /><br /><br />Now, for the Palpatine reveal for Rey, I was just like, &quot;Yep, I can buy it.&quot;, but at the same time, I thought it was weird to think of Palpatine as a sexual entity. Like, I know it&#39;s a &quot;human&quot; thing to do, but, at the same time... it&#39;s weird. But, I do like the damage control they did with Rey&#39;s parents because it sounds like some sort of D&amp;D fix, like, &quot;Oh, here is this one thing that we assumed, but that assumption is only partially true!&quot;, I liked that bit of damage control, like, I could get behind it.<br /><br /><br />I wished that they almost did a bounty hunt for the Jedi Hunter or whatever that creature was that was looking for Rey&#39;s parents, and Rey herself. Instead of just... you know, having him be dead in a cave. That could&#39;ve been really dark and terrifying and added to the creepiness that they were trying to exude from the Emperor.<br /><br /><br />Now, the Emperor looked wicked. Like, he looked so fucked up and on the verge of death, but, &quot;The dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... unnatural.&quot;, I liked that and so I bought it. But, it felt like it weakened what happened in Return of the Jedi. Like, that was Vader&#39;s redemption, he killed Palpatine to save his son, but doing so killed him. So, him being brought back was kinda like, &quot;So, Vader just... died and didn&#39;t really kill his master and bring balance to the Force...&quot;<br /><br />Next, two lightsabers to reflect Force Lightning? Boy, if only Mace Windu had two lightsabers this could&#39;ve stopped at Revenge of the Sith. So, part of me didn&#39;t buy the feedback thing. Also, on a separate note, FINN IS FORCE-SENSITIVE? What the heck, I know that it was probably JJ&#39;s vision to have Finn be Force Sensitive in The Last Jedi, due to him wielding a lightsaber in The Force Awakens and battling with it. But, due to the lack of foreshadowing in The Last Jedi, it was poorly done. <br /><br /><br />Also, Ben is just... gone? What the freaking heck? THE most three dimensional character we&#39;ve ever seen in a Star Wars film, and he redeems himself and just, disappears? Doesn&#39;t try to atone for his misgivings? Decides that if he has Rey who believes in him, and wants him to be him, not somebody that people wish him to be or expect him to be, he&#39;ll be happy? No moral message to those experiencing dark times and can take some sort of moral or ethical take away from Ben&#39;s arc? NOTHING?! What a waste of his arc...<br /><br /><br />Also, Knights of Ren, completely wasted. Should&#39;ve come up during The Last Jedi, especially with a title like that, they should&#39;ve been something similar to the Inquisitors where they were fucking terrifying to come across. <br /><br /><br />All that being said, let&#39;s end this on a high note, there were some really cool scenes, some of them that you mentioned, but one keeps sticking out in my mind. The ones you mentioned is when Luke came around the corner and was just like, &quot;This should be treated with respect.&quot; and he has his talk with Rey. Also, when Harrison Ford made the cameo, that was really cool, and they used the same lines from The Force Awakens because it was only a memory and it felt like Ben took those words by his father and made the meanings of them more valuable and that despite his fall, he believed in him and him not bowing to the expectation of others. Han Solo was a great embodiment of that and I took that Ben finally realized it and embraced it and threw away Kylo Ren.<br /><br /><br />The moment I loved most is when all the voices were joining together to say, &quot;Join me.&quot;, and I heard Vader&#39;s voice saying, &quot;Join meee...&quot; and I got all the goddamn chills dude.", "textOriginal": "i have quite a few comments.

Let&#39;s list them.\r<br />\r<br />Kylo Ren&#39;s Helmet: It&#39;s not a retcon, Kylo was seen staring at Vader&#39;s helmet before the helmet was mended, and got it repaired alongside the Knights of Ren. He felt he needed it to demonstrate his leadership to the knights (their small amount of screen time was unfortunate, but besides the point), but his secret reason was taking inspiration from Vader in finding a way to kill the emperor. He barely wore it anyhow. Plus, in the first movie he was bound to follow his past, in the second he ws hellbent on killing it, and in the third, he&#39;s comfortable and at peace with it (now he&#39;s lived up to Vader in being a leader). TROS completed the development, and he barely wore it anyway (and only around the knights). There&#39;s a reason that the cracks were frequently brought up. It can also be argued that it was to keep his emotions hidden as the leader, and keep people in line. He also only wore it in front of the knights and FO.\r<br />\r<br />The resistance &quot;suddenly&quot; allies: No, this was all due to Luke&#39;s sacrifice.\r<br />\r<br />Luke&#39;s attitude towards Lightsabers: This was not a shot towards Rian Johnson, when Luke accepted his old lightsaber in TLJ itself. The guy had demons for various reasons in TLJ, defeated them, and came around by the time of TROS. This is simply just NOT a retcon.\r<br />\r<br />Rey&#39;s parents: By definiton, this isn&#39;t a retcon because Rey&#39;s PARENTS were still nobodies. Whilst some may argue that this retcons her Arc as a nobody doing great things, I think they missed the point. In TLJ, she was someone who was thought to come from a line of nobodies, and rising above it to be somebody. TROS took that a step forward, and had her arc and development revolve around having an ancestor be the most Evil and bloodstained man in the galaxy, but rising above it to be somebody good and be a good person. In other words, in TLJ she has dealing with viewing herself as a zero or neutral but wanting to be a positive, yet in TROS, she dealt with viewing herself as an extreme negative yet wanting to do extremely positive things. Rey in spanish means king (since Reina is too Earth for star wars), (and they couldn&#39;t have named her emperatiz), just like Vader always meant Father.\r<br />\r<br />Rey Owning The Lightsaber: She probably said she wasn&#39;t worthy yet because she still had the dark urges we saw in the movie before it began. It was also a critical time for the resistance in TLJ so was the only weapon she had. It&#39;s not like she had any choice. She also tried to return it to Luke not once, but twice. She was also probably inspired by Luke&#39;s TLJ act.\r<br />\r<br />Rey rejecting Kylo at the end of TLJ doesn&#39;t mean anything: She OPENLY says she wanted Ben&#39;s hand, which she took in TLJ.\r<br />\r<br />Luke had a lightsaber on Ach-To: Not a retcon. He threw his old saber because he was ashamed of his violence, and also wanted no more Jedi business at the time. He kept Leia&#39;s because it was Leia&#39;s, and wouldn&#39;t throw something that wasn&#39;t his. It may have even been a way to keep himself from going totally crazy by keep a memento of her by his side, seeing as though she didn&#39;t really want to be a Jedi anyway.\r<br />\r<br />Rose being sidelined to please her detractors: Unlikely, this was just fed by the retcon misconceptions. It was a packed movie and not everyone could get time, with new characters being introduced. Rose got even more time than Maz, even though Maz was JJ&#39;s baby. Plus, unlike Maz, Rose was on the battle of Exegol.\r<br />\r<br />Kylo killing Snoke means nothing since snoke was just Palpatine: First off, it was instrumental to Kylo&#39;s development, in becoming his own guy and answering to nobody, which was continued in TROS, as early as the opening crawl, where Kylo was said to seek out Palpatine as he saw him as a threat to his power. Kylo openly said to Palpatine that he&#39;ll kill him first, and never bought in to Palpatine&#39;s offer. Even in TLJ, Snoke&#39;s monologue in TLJ before he got shanked included &quot;kills his TRUE enemy&quot;. Whilst some can argue that it undermines Kylo&#39;s act, they should consider that Kylo didn&#39;t know shit and did it anyway. Secondly, Kylo killing Snoke was him choosing not to kill Rey, as he obviously loved her. Even if Snoke&#39;s death was foreseen by Palpatine, it doesn&#39;t change that Kylo made the choice to choose Rey over him, and take power for himself and not bow down to the Emperor. Personally, I don&#39;t think it lessens Kylo , but instead makes the Emperor even more cunning as a Villain, since Kylo developed anyway. This also makes sense, since Snoke was also very interested in Rey.\r<br />\r<br />Palpatine randomly coming in: The clues were always there. Him and Rey&#39;s theme, Rey&#39;s fighting style in BOTH movies (she was fucking vicious in the praetorian guard fight, even more than Kylo!), Rey&#39;s dark side in TLJ. Snoke quoting Palpatine so much in his monologue, the F.O just being a new Empire, the look of the red guards, and most importantly, Rey and Palpatine&#39;s theme&#39;s main riffs starting off the same (play Palp&#39;s theme speed up by 1.75, and play Rey&#39;s, both the main parts, and you&#39;ll see). Hell, Snoke looked SO fucked up, that there could have been NO injury that would cause a person to live like that instead of dying. WHY would they have played Palpatine&#39;s theme at the pivotal Rey torture theme if he wasn&#39;t Palpatine?\r<br />\r<br />The skywalker lightsaber gets fixed: I think the point of it having been broken in TLJ was demonstrate that Kylo had becoming more powerful in killing Snoke and ridding himself of the conflict that held him back (that even Snoke referred to), since in TLJ, the tug of war is completely even, yet in TFA, Rey had a bigger pull (as her light side drew it to her more powerfully than Kylo after killing his Father) even though she was farther away. They didn&#39;t tie the lightsaber into the killing the past theme, which is why Luke had it, and Kylo was pissed that he thought Luke had it. It was also a hint that Luke wasn&#39;t really there. With the importance placed on that one lightsaber in BOTH of the first two movies, they wouldn&#39;t just destroy it.\r<br />\r<br />Killing the past: They&#39;re killing Palpatine aren&#39;t they? Addressed a major prequel plot point.\r<br />\r<br />I think people need to just watch the movies and stop looking for reasons to bitch about Disney. At the end of the day, they made a movie that not everyone liked (like TESB when it came out), and people were just hysterical. A lot of people acted embarassingly in this rabbit hole. I can&#39;t believe that these Star Wars politcker youtubers get THAT much traction. I&#39;m a Star Wars fan who has a life outside the franchise. Why can&#39;t other people be?\r<br />\r<br />Other moments of TLJ continuity:\r<br />\r<br />Poe is super serious and anxious throughout the movie, following TLJ, and barely ever smiles. None of the &quot;YEEHAW&quot; type stuff from the first two movies happened. Instead of a one man show, he repeatedly stresses the importance of help.\r<br />\r<br />Rey not striking Palpatine down and passing the lighstaber to Ben was &quot;not fighting what you hate, but saving what you love&quot;. She even said she wouldn&#39;t hate him.\r<br />\r<br />People keep saying that the Trilogy had no roadmap. That not really true. JJ was right in saying that TLJ didn&#39;t derail his plans, and they wouldn&#39;t have allowed TLJ if it did. They probably fired Colin Trevorrow for a reason similar (although that could have been due to his quality).\r<br />\r<br />I think some people loved the Disney hate bandwagon more than Star Wars, and only have themselves to blame for not hating TLJ civilly but keeping an open mind. Disappointment and entitlement go hand in hand.  <br /><br /><br />Don&#39;t let this guy mislead you.
