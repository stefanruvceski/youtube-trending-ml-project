I have some problems with it, but it&#39;s the best in this trilogy. Though I disagree with you saying that you don&#39;t need to see The Last Jedi to watch this film. <br />If you skip The Last Jedi you&#39;ll be confused as to why Snoke isn&#39;t around anymore, why Luke is a force ghost, how Rey and Kylo are having those force Skype calls, why Hux hates Kylo and a handful of other minor things. <br />And though a lot of people are saying this movie retcons The Last Jedi, I have to disagree with that too. It&#39;s not a very smooth transition but it does follow through with what The Last Jedi set up. Luke catching the lightsaber isn&#39;t just simply a jab at The Last Jedi, because in that film Luke went through his character arc of having given up, to realising he was wrong and helping the Resistance. Luke catching the lightsaber follows naturally. Palpatine being behind Snoke and what Kylo thought to be Vader&#39;s voice is also a logical follow-up from Snoke&#39;s character being killed off so simply. Though I wish the final force Skype call between Rey and Kylo at the end of The Last Jedi was caused by Palpatine (as Snoke said he connected them all those times prior). Rey being a Palpatine helps explain why she&#39;s a Mary Sue, but doesn&#39;t fix the problem entirely. And Rey&#39;s parents being &quot;nobody&quot; never sat well with me. I&#39;m glad the film was set quite some time after The Last Jedi and it shows her training at the start, though it does feel a bit like it&#39;s too little too late.<br /><br />Let&#39;s not forget that people love the original trilogy but there&#39;s plenty of &quot;retconning&quot; in that too. All the stuff about Darth Vader being Luke&#39;s father despite Obi Wan saying that Vader killed Luke&#39;s father, and then the whole &quot;from a certain point of view&quot; talk to explain it all. And Leia saying &quot;somehow I always knew&quot; about being Luke&#39;s sister despite having passionately kissed him on the lips in the previous film. <br /><br />If you&#39;re angry at Rise of Skywalker for &quot;retconning&quot; then you should be equally angry at Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.", "textOriginal": "I liked the movie too.
