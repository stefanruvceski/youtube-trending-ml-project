Changing votes at the voting tally machine is hard? Make it so every vote has to have proof of work, and make that proof of work take at least a second (or other reasonable time scale) to do. Large scale changes would require incredible amounts of time to do if they could be done at all (a variant on forward perfect secrecy might even make it impossible), this is literally what things like bcrypt are meant to solve. Force voting machine code to be open. Not every user of the software needs to understand the software if it&#39;s open, as long as enough people that DO understand it look at it. Transport the data by pulling out the hard drives. Lock those hard drives into a transport unit that blocks access to the data ports prior to transport, this is just as effective if not more than sealed paper boxes.

Changing votes at the voting tally machine is hard? Make it so every vote has to have proof of work, and make that proof of work take at least a second (or other reasonable time scale) to do. Large scale changes would require incredible amounts of time to do if they could be done at all (a variant on forward perfect secrecy might even make it impossible), this is literally what things like bcrypt are meant to solve. Force voting machine code to be open. Not every user of the software needs to understand the software if it's open, as long as enough people that DO understand it look at it.
