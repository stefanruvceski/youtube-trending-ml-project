I&#39;ve seen all 3 of the sequel films in the cinema. But I came out devastated or hugely disappointed every time. All 3 movies had incredible music by John Williams who is a GOD! I love his work! That&#39;s about all the good things they have in common. This film was the most beautiful out of all 9 films I loved General Pryde finally a capable leader who will give you chills as Tarkin did. But overall I didn&#39;t like the cinematography or the VFX work. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt like I&#39;ve had a problem with cinematography in a quote and quote professional Hollywood film. I was just sad and frustrated. I&#39;ve felt that J.J. Abrams was an incompetent writer/director.  Which made me even more depressed, because I know he is a huge fan who has poured his heart and soul into this film. Before and during film school I watched J. J.&#39;s lecture that he delivered in a TED talk years before Disney bought Lucasarts. In this lecture, he spoke about his love of Star Wars among other things. Anyways going back to the film. The film was a narrative disaster. It was lacking any creativity and craftsmanship. He took the rules of writing and threw it all out of the window. Within the first 2-3 minutes, my friend wanted to bet me that Kylo and Rey will end up tag-teaming against Palpatine. To which I responded with a no, because I didn&#39;t want to bet on a sure thing. We both knew ahead of time how it will and the same goes for the kissing. I think almost any film which has an ending this predictable has a failed script at least in some respects. Giving away Palpatine in the first minute is a huge-huge problem, both in the film and its marketing material. The film lacks almost any sort of real obstacle&#39;s to get to Palpatine I didn&#39;t doubt for a second that both of them would get to him. The film is full of meaningless sidequests without any real obstacles. Like how C3PO-s memory wipe had no real sense of obstacle it was just way to drag the story onwards without real dramatic progression. They never have to think hard, fight hard, suffer to get anything, all they need to do is travel to places and everything will fall into their laps. The way death is handled here (too) just makes it really hard to take any death scenes seriously. But anyway the 1 scene that showed me total incompetence as a writer and director is when they flew to that gorgeous ice place (planet?).  They go into a small hole and dock the ship so that R2-D2 can download an intel. They have downloaded the Intel and that&#39;s when the imperial&#39;s start to appear in the whole. This does not create suspense!!! If they wanted to create real suspense all they had to do without draging the scene out. Is to change the order of the clips in the editing timeline. If they&#39;re still nowhere near close to downloading the intel (which didn&#39;t seem to crucial it should&#39;ve felt more crucial) when TIE fighters are already close by then there would&#39;ve been a real sense of suspense. And have them escape in the last minute. And then J.J. also broke (after breaking a bunch of writing rules) all the in-universe rules that were set up by the previous films.  I hope he will make something great again like Super8, but this was disheartening. I love the channel keep it up, it&#39;s so much fun even if we don&#39;t agree on this film!
