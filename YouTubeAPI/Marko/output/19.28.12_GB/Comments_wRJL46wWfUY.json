From 2k reviews all the way, well the last time I checked, to around 30-40k reviews, it was stuck at 86%. That would be mathematically impossible. Especially since it's pretty much, at minimum, 86% of the people seeing this are life long fans hoping that this movie really did fix it. Since it took away the entire Skywalker saga and made it mainly a Palpatine saga, I'm going to say, there is no way it got an 86% fan score.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-24T18:35:47.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-24T18:35:47.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/7P-R6xSjHLe_AR4wDqP9PYGnWL0\"", "id": "Ugxr4NAoaM_01cX1CwB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "wRJL46wWfUY", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/cRkzqTWz-1KaVMjHu7otq88z3vA\"", "id": "Ugxr4NAoaM_01cX1CwB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "tony curtis", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_u_1t95CD5BhrqlF5skg-8itIpOnBdQgMPKA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs-ZaG5XVnCkSOEWEZrJpbQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCs-ZaG5XVnCkSOEWEZrJpbQ"}, "videoId": "wRJL46wWfUY", "textDisplay": "The most shocking part for me was star destroyers.....buried underground.....on a planet no one can get too......and they have no upward thrusters.
