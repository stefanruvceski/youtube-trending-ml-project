The Force Awakens was very derivative but did a good job of reintroducing the world of Star Wars and getting people excited to see some promising new and interesting characters, but it absolutely needed The Last Jedi to instil some purpose, direction and soul to the trilogy that was uniquely its own that would've (if they'd leaned into it) achieved something transcendent by the end of episode 9.  Instead we got a cacophony of extraneous elements introduced at the series's 11th hour out of the blue and with nothing to set them up, coupled with spineless, cynical, market research-esque approach to try and appease a loud minority of self righteous internet brats who have no idea about the fundamentals of what makes for good story-telling, but preferred to see Luke do a bunch of back-flips and light sabre fighting and to crush star destroyers with his mind etc instead of go through some actual character development and challenges.
