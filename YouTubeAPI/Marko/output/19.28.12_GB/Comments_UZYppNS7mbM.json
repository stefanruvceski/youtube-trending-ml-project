Having Rey be a Palpatine is a shit idea, doesn't mater how much time you have to build it up. Was there a added benefit to the story or plot? No. Did the emperor actually need her? No. Strike me down! or don't and i'll just drain you instead. Also yeah that fleet is still there either way.  It was a gimic to explain all the OP bullshit they pulled of so far and its still idiotic and inconsistent. Not to mention the nr of times a character \"died\" and was fine. Chewy, 3PO, Kylo 2x, Finn, Fly boys girlfriend etc. These aren't arc's there circles coz they're pointless and don't go anywhere. Did any one actually buy that crap? \n\n\n\nAs for Character development what was there? Kylo has a change of heart coz his mom died? He killed his dad and blew her in to space, why would he give a shit now? Oh right need to force that teamwork in. Reys confrontation with her own darkness is just glossed over, i mean how does she deal with her dark alter? By falling out the f*cking room. Your last name should not be a bigger issue then your actually issues. Oh and hey fin and the pilot dude both get new girlfriends kinda, so thats a thing. \n\n\n\nAlso the fleet doesn't know which way is up? Are you FUCKING KIDDING? They just sat there with there d*cks hanging out?  And whats the stake? Oh they blow up planets...again. ANd a entire civilian fleet show up ad does...what exactly?
