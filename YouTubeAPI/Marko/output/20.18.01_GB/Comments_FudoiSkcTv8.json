That is NOT their speciality, that is WHY there are Psychiatric specialists, Social Workers, and Therapists. <br />Also, many of the older PCP&#39;s in the medical community still prescribe older meds, SNRI&#39;s or SSRI&#39;s like Nortriptyline, Prozac and Zoloft, for example, which have so many more serious and long term side effects than newer, more multifaceted or refined meds. I&#39;ve seen PCP&#39;s that still have copies of old DSM&#39;s hanging around their office, which it&#39;s fine for reference if you&#39;re looking back to old notes or how a patient was diagnosed and with what criteria years ago, but have the new DSM-V sitting there and clearly haven&#39;t even cracked it open to see how diagnoses have changed over the years - and oh how they&#39;ve changed!<br />Also, PCP&#39;s don&#39;t regularly administer PHQ-9&#39;s or score for GAD, or do Kessler screenings, conduct AUDIT, PC-PTSD, SSRS, DAST, LEC, or CAGE assessments.<br />Proper dx&#39;ing, therapy, and the right medication or combination of meds are invaluable to a person who needs it and if a patient is brave enough to ask for help, you should be humble enough to refer them to the proper treatment.<br />If a patient&#39;s problems are not temporary or situational, then PCP&#39;s should ALWAYS refer patients to mental health clinicians for further evaluation and/or therapy if there are serious and persistent Mental Health issues that meet criteria for any MH diagnosis. Any corresponding medications should be prescribed and monitored by a PSYCHIATRIST, a Dr of Psychiatry who is familiar with Psychiatric meds, their side effects, the appropriate meds for specific diagnoses, and can treat for servere reactions such as dysphoria, suicidal thoughts or ideations as side effects, for example. PCP&#39;s are NOT fully equipped for this and many times, if a patient brings up SI/HI, a PCP&#39;s first inclination as a mandated reporter is to call mobile crisis for an eval or require a patient MHA, where a therapist or PSYCHIATRIC Dr will be able to evaluate in the spot, make a determination, and have a much better understanding of whether this is a symptom of a MH d/o or an adverse reaction to a medication. <br />Dr. Mike,<br />I hate to say this, but it seems you are a Dr to the stars now. You made it, good for you. But now you serves people with deep pockets - rich people with money and extra resources and disposable income that have the privilege of trying expensive alternative, osteopathic medicine, having fulfilling, meaningful appointments with time to spare. Your patients have the luxury to be picky about who they choose as their doctors and get to build good rapport with you. And I&#39;d bet money that your patients are either private pay or have private insurance.<br />Your office is probably not in an inner city, you most likely don&#39;t serve marginalized communities like mine or people on government insurance like myself that have to call 50 doctors offices to try to find a primary care physician that is even accepting new patients and if they are, do they speak my language and do they accept Medicaid or Medicare? And THAT&#39;S where the system starts to break down for MOST of the people in our country - we&#39;re just trying to get even one foot in the door.<br />You&#39;re right about one thing you said - the Mental Health System is even harder to access. But it&#39;s up to our PCP&#39;s to ADVOCATE for us! Call over referrals if need be, find out the community resources and put together a packet of them and have copies printed to provide to us at your office, call and check in or schedule follow up visits to check in on our mood and actually call us back if we call and say we need help,let us know about Health Home Care Management Services provided by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations, tell us about resources like NAMI and P4SP, find out and tell us about any local drop-in centers where they have Mental Health Providers on site. Do Not to try to play Psychiatrist to us. That&#39;s just plain unethical and dangerous and it is inadequate care.<br />In my case, and in so many others who can barely find a PCP to accept them as a new patient, let alone get an appointment, forget building rapport with them. And sometimes they are just ASSIGNED by Medicaid and people don&#39;t even know that they have a PCP listed on their insurance policy! Insane! <br />Then when a person puts their last thread of hope and energy into doing the work to sign up for insurance and make those calls and obtain that PCP - because let&#39;s say they have diabetes and Schizoaffective d/o - they try to get an appointment and they&#39;re told they can&#39;t get one for 5 weeks. That&#39;s what MOST of the general population either working poor or dealing with some sort of disability and on gov&#39;t insurance. Most folks with Mental Health dx&#39;s out here in the real world, not the YouTube world, have Mcaid or Mcare or huge Spend downs or essential plans with huge deductibles. <br />So, you see, no rapport built, and the next time that person goes, they&#39;ll most likely see a nurse practitioner, a nurse, or a different doctor.<br />I remember what I was like to be wealthy and have private insurance when I was still able to work. I went to quiet Dr offices of my choosing with ceiling to floor cascade waterfalls, cushy, clean couches, a quiet room to relax, and coffee and tea stations. Then my brain got sick. No, really, my actual brain - I have a neurological disorder, and then Mental Health dx&#39;s followed - and I had to go on SSD at 28 years old and get government insurance and find a new doctor because the one I&#39;d had for 10 years that I had &quot;rapport&quot; with didn&#39;t accept my new &#39;second-class-citizen&#39; insurance. In an instant,that rapport meant nothing any I was left to fend for myself. No recommendations of new physicians from my once beloved Doc no resources to follow up with, no good luck. Just don&#39;t forget to pay your last copay on the way out before your &#39;good&#39; insurance ends.<br /><br />10 years later and it&#39;s not just the same, it&#39;s so much worse. The underserved populations and marginalized communities end up at Health Care Centers that are a revolving door of new doctors, nurses, and support staff monthly, usually in not so great neighborhoods in beatup, old, sterile looking buildings to keep overhead costs down because they&#39;re only get reimbursed for services at Medicaid or Medicare rates and that barely keeps the lights on.<br /><br />Dr Mike - You just don&#39;t seem to get it. There is a Mental Health CRISIS. Ignorance on behalf of PCP&#39;s is partly to blame for misdiagnosis, improper courses of treatment or negligence in regards to follow-up. For example, many patients aren&#39;t educated about the importance of med compliance, especially life-or-death implications of the proper use of benzodiazepines often prescribed like candy by PCP&#39;s for anxiety, for example - because that&#39;s not something that PCP&#39;s think of - that&#39;s something that PSYCHIATRISTS and MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS think of.<br /><br />Lady Gaga is from NYC.
