Here I show you that one of the biggest muscles in the forearm, responsible for a major portion of the size, is not even technically a forearm muscle. The brachioradialis is a powerful elbow flexor that also has abilities to pronate the forearm. Many will focus all of their forearm workouts and exercises on wrist curls and wrist extensions. This is a mistake when trying to build up mass in the forearm muscles.To start, it helps to revisit the anatomy of the lower arm. The brachioradialis starts on the upper arm bone, the humerus, and inserts on the distal end of the radius (the bone on the thumb side of the forearm). This muscle does not cross the wrist joint and therefore has no action on the wrist. This means that the brachioradialis does not extend or flex the wrist like the other forearm muscles does.In order to work it the most you need to spend your time focusing on the actions of the elbow, specifically flexing the elbow. The position with which you do this matters however. If you do it with the forearm supinated you will instantly place most of the load on the biceps rather than the brachioradialis. To get the brachioradialis you will want to have your forearm either in neutral or pronated. Here is where some controversy comes in.Many will point to the fact that the brachioradialis is strongest in the neutral position of the forearm. This is true. That does not mean however that the muscle is most fully shortened or activated in this position. It can achieve a greater level of contraction when it is both flexed at the elbow and pronated at the forearm. Does this mean that you should not train it out of the neutral position? No. It means that you can choose exercises that allow it to be trained heavier for progressive overload in this position but that you still need to include forearm exercises that allow it to be trained from a pronated position. The most classic forearm exercise when it comes to this is the reverse barbell curl. Here, you can do it with either a straight bar to achieve the fully pronated position or with an EZ bar to get a more neutral position. Remember to adjust your weights accordingly to stimulate the muscle as discussed above. Also, the amount of brachioradialis activation is higher with elbow flexion above 90 degrees so remember not to cut the range of motion short on any rep.You can also do this with dumbbells. As shown, you can hold the dumbbell with an offset grip which will help you to overload pronation at the same time that you can flex the elbow to train the brachioradialis optimally. The version shown here is good at accomplishing both and can be done with most dumbbells at the gym.The lat pulldown variation is another great option for achieving a reverse curl and training the brachioradialis to get bigger forearms. The key is to keep the bar moving behind the head and not just to the head to take advantage of the greater activation with greater elbow flexion.When it comes down to it however, if you want to get jacked forearms one of the easiest things you can do is remember to pick up the weights when you‚Äôre done with them. Yes, the position of carrying plates and racking them is one of the best ways to activate this muscle and get it to grow with the additional volume you achieve by doing this repeatedly during the workout week. Not just that, you‚Äôll be more liked at the gym for not being that guy who never picks up his weights.If you‚Äôre looking to get bigger forearms and want to build your entire body at the same time, be sure to head to athleanx.com at the link below.

A modern day version can be found here: https://store.arnoldmagnetics.com/product/284/magnetic-viewer-b-1022Special thanks to Andy on Twitter who first made me aware of this device back in 2016https://twitter.com/andyAVAVsystems/status/786861354594492416?s=20FAQsQ) CAN IT SEE WHATS ON A FLOPPY DISK?A) No - It didn‚Äôt show anything on a 5.25‚Äù floppy I tested (BOTH SIDES)Considering the viewer is pretty much maxed-out for resolution by an 8 track, (8 tracks recorded on a tape 1/4‚Äù wide at 3.75 ips) I‚Äôd imagine that anything more dense than this will be beyond the capabilities of what can be displayed by the device. I‚Äôll try an 8‚Äù disk soon - but I would be shocked if it shows anything for the same density reasons  Q) You can buy these sheets of magnetic viewing paper that do the same thing. A) They don‚Äôt have the same resolution or sensitivity - at least the ones I‚Äôve bought don‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt show the magnetic signal and track layout on a tape. Nothing registered when I tried. Q) You can use this fluid stuff that does the same jobA) A few people are mentioning various ways to do this with a liquid smeared on the tape  - These were known about - and likely made by 3M as well - but one reason for the development of the magnetic tape viewer was that it was a ‚Äònon destructive‚Äô way to read the tape - here‚Äôs an except from their patent application where they mention one of the existing and alternative methods to do the same thing.‚ÄúHeretofore magnetic signals recorded on magnetic tape have in a sense been rendered visible by smearing finely divided ferromagnetic material over the tape and allowing it to migrate to points of maximum magnetic flux.  Besides being slow and messy this procedure involved the greater disadvantage that thorough cleaning of the recording medium was required to prevent the applied ferromagnetic  material from supplying false  signals.  This procedure is treated in the television industry as unacceptable for the splicing of magnetic recording tape and splicing has instead been confined to tape areas in which the picture is blanked out.‚ÄùQ) Who is the voice in the Datsun Commercial?A) Danny DarkQ) What‚Äôs the white pad on the left for. A) Thats the ‚ÄòViewing Pad‚Äô - to see a picture of it being used - freeze the video at 02:51Q) What‚Äôs the spectrum analyser to the left of the Reel to Reel?A) It‚Äôs demonstrated in this video https://youtu.be/6kVIciuZtwMAvailable from here: https://www.nixiekits.eu/product.php?key=nixielyzer---------------SUBSCRIBE------------------ http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1-------------Merchandise-----------------https://teespring.com/stores/techmoan-merch-------------SUPPORT---------------This channel can be supported through Patreon https://www.patreon.com/techmoan  *******Patrons usually have early access to videos*******----------Outro Music-----------Over Time - Vibe Tracks https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw------Outro Sound Effect------ThatSFXGuy - https://youtu.be/5M3-ZV5-QDM"

Thank you for caring about me. It means more to me than you could possibly know. ---In January 2020, a documentary was released called ‚ÄúThe Witnesses.‚Äù TRIGGER WARNING: basically all the worst things people can do‚ÄúThe Witnesses‚Äù can be found on Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/A-Window-For-Justice/dp/B084TDX7L3or Oxygen: https://www.oxygen.com/the-witnesses/season-1/the-watchtowerand also on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/tv/show?id=S9vTv9nX1qTSiAwvdSGC-Q and other places on the internet if you dig deep enough. I encourage you to watch it and share it. I believe the survivors. I know survivors. I am a survivor. (UPDATE 2/29:If you need resources or are looking for answers about the JWs:https://www.jwfacts.com/ & https://jw.support/)---I can‚Äôt describe what it feels like to be a child rejected by their parent. It strips you of your humanity. It makes you a shell. Nothing more than an object someone can opt-in to cherish and love when convenient for them and their beliefs. It reduces you to a choice. I am not a choice. I am a person deserving of love and respect. Back in August, my Dad and step-mom pulled me aside to tell me that they would not be coming to my wedding. I had included them on a list of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù e-mails my wedding planner asked for, but had assumed we would all silently agree not to discuss it. That surely I had suffered enough. That I had struggled enough. That I had lost enough family already. But they needed to remind me that my love was unnatural, immoral, and a crime within their organization.  To remind me that Ella wasn‚Äôt worthy of being in a family photo. And lastly, to remind me that if I ever used my public platform to speak out against their organization that that ‚Äúwould be it.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs taken me six months to decide I am comfortable with that. My Dad is an Elder. I was a raised a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. I was never baptized. However, I grew up in the organization, I can recite all the names of the literature from memory, I‚Äôve been to more District Conventions and Memorial Services than I care to recall. I‚Äôve gone out in Field Service. I‚Äôve preached Door to Door. I still have the songs singing in my head. I grew up fearing my annihilation and the annihilation of everyone who is not a Witness. Returning to the choices we make‚Ä¶ I choose to share this:I do not believe it is a safe or healthy environment for women or children. I believe it protects those it should not protect. I believe it holds itself above the law. I believe it is a cult. If you would like to learn more about The Witnesses - I encourage you to speak to people who have fled the cult and lost everything in the process. Again, I was never officially baptized, and yet this organization has taken from me something I desperately wanted to carry through this life and into the next - the unconditional love and support of a parent."

This summer, Oscar¬Æ winner Jordan Peele unleashes a fresh take on the blood-chilling urban legend that your friend‚Äôs older sibling probably told you about at a sleepover: Candyman. Rising filmmaker Nia DaCosta (Little Woods) directs this contemporary incarnation of the cult classic.  For as long as residents can remember, the housing projects of Chicago‚Äôs Cabrini Green neighborhood were terrorized by a word-of-mouth ghost story about a supernatural killer with a hook for a hand, easily summoned by those daring to repeat his name five times into a mirror. In present day, a decade after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, visual artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; HBO‚Äôs Watchmen, Us) and his girlfriend, gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris; If Beale Street Could Talk, The Photograph), move into a luxury loft condo in Cabrini, now gentrified beyond recognition and inhabited by upwardly mobile millennials.With Anthony‚Äôs painting career on the brink of stalling, a chance encounter with a Cabrini Green old-timer (Colman Domingo; HBO‚Äôs Euphoria, Assassination Nation) exposes Anthony to the tragically horrific nature of the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifyingly viral wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny.Universal Pictures presents, from Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures and Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld‚Äôs Monkeypaw Productions, in association with BRON Creative, Candyman. Candyman is directed by DaCosta, and is produced by Ian Cooper (Us), Rosenfeld and Peele. The screenplay is by Peele & Rosenfeld and DaCosta. The film is based on the 1992 film Candyman, written by Bernard Rose, and the short story ‚ÄúThe Forbidden‚Äù by Clive Barker. The film‚Äôs executive producers are David Kern, Aaron L. Gilbert and Jason Cloth."
