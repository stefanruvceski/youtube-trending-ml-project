I genuinely appreciate you being even-handed about it,  because I don&#39;t want to avoid talking about Star Wars, but I also like my health and happiness. <br /><br />I do want to bring up my perspective on these films (which I enjoyed) as a counter and an observation: <br />First, reading it thematically, JJ Abrams leaned into some elements of the Last Jedi&#39;s themes: It is the family&#39;s we choose that matter, not the ones we are born into and &quot;we win by protecting the things we love, not by attacking the things we hate&quot;. And those threads are what drive the film&#39;s conflict. <br /><br />But also, it&#39;s clear that JJ Abrams looked at the preceding 8 films and felt that it made sense, in retconning it as the &quot;Skywalker Saga&quot; that Palpatine was the monster/villain of that saga; given that he&#39;s run things from the shadows, Abrams used it - and member berries - to bring him back to wrap up the story in a bow. He also leaned into the final chapter apocalyptic battle element. I will concede that this was done at Disney&#39;s behest so that they can expand the universe to other stories, but I had no problem with it, mostly because Abrams is a reasonably competent (if often shallow) storyteller. One of the major tropes of longform storytelling like this is the final part has to be suitably apocalyptic, and the sith/jedi dynamic has been the ongoing thread pulling it together. So I bought it. <br /><br />And, further, this film - like the preceding two - took notes from that George Lucas&#39;s quote about the film series being a poem where each film rhymes. If you track the plot beats for this film, you can see it is rhyming with Return of the Jedi, just as The Last Jedi rhymed with Empire. DJ and Cantobight definitely took notes from Lando Calrissian/Cloud City/Bespin plot points, but not exactly the same beats. But, being the final rhyme of this poem, it also tries to encapsulate all the rhymes from the preceding film and look back on them. For the record, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a perfect film and don&#39;t find it did a transcendantl job of closing the series. But I was satisfied, and so feel compelled to defend it. <br /><br />But to the other, major points: watching those videos had an impact on your opinion of this film. I have observed that the people who have spent the most time on youtube with those videos had the strongest negative reaction to it. I do not think it is a coincidence. it&#39;s a kind of priming, where you are going to be looking for errors more than you would have. The people who are casual fans, or don&#39;t watch those critiques struck me as the happiest with the end product. <br /><br />And I do think that the fanbase shares the onus of the legacy of these films. Disney is doing what is in its best interest, and I&#39;m not going to blame it for listening to the fanbase. But the fanbase has been consistently and aggressively toxic since the release of the prequel trilogies. The evidence is overwhelming: George Lucas sold the franchise, Jar Jar Binks actor was pushed to being suicidal, Daisy Ridley and Kelly Marie Tran have left social media ENTIRELY, and that&#39;s only the most obvious damage. So, to an extent, I think the fandom should act on its capacity for self-reflection to see what role they played. They won&#39;t, and they can&#39;t, but I would love if they did. <br /><br />And one final point: the original trilogy was not always a trilogy. There are plenty of moments that demonstrate that. It was planned by Lucas, and others expressed his vision. I&#39;m sure you know this. But Star Wars has always been a corporatized entity, that has - at its best - relied on a committee to tell its best stories. So I find most of the complaints about Disney to be bad faith, or reflective of maturing, and not a function of the film&#39;s inherent failings. <br /><br />And, also, The Empire Strikes back was poorly received when it was released, it just didn&#39;t have the internet. <br /><br />Again, thank you for being decent about this. I am genuinely sorry that this film and franchise have become a sore spot for you. It really breaks my heart that you aren&#39;t able to enjoy this franchise as much as you once did. <br /><br />And, if you actually read this. Thank you.
