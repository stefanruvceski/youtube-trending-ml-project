She hopes he suffers. But through seeing him in such pain and confusion, in tandem with the Jedi training she feels good in Ren. Luke had lost himself in the force to fight his grief so his emotions were dulled, but through the Rey reminding him of his humanity he goes with Rey to save Ren. They enter the planet Luke feels the weight of the dark side pressing on him he says he can feel the dark heart of the planet and tries to heal it. Rey not waiting because of Rens pain rushes off to find him. She finds him undergoing restructuring in a tank. She gets him out to find the liquid burns her and that he was being constantly broken and remade in the tank to strip away his humanity. That\u2019s when Snoke arrives, he awoke the dark side of Ren and the cries for help she felt were his last vestiges trying to be saved. Ren opens up his eyes and they are Sith yellow. Snoke lightnings Rey and tells his apprentice to show off his new power. At that point Luke manages to cut of the dark heart of the planet causing Snoke to fly in a rage and go to find Luke and reconnect to the Core. Rey fights Ren and he overpowers her easily, she runs while trying to reawaken his light side. But he appears more monster then man now, QUIET and ruthless when he gets injured he barely reacts and instead force drains those around him. Rey struggles she is about to fall when she forces open the connection in their mind and it stuns both of them. Luke arrives to find them both twitching on the floor, he gets them to the ship straps them down and starts to fly away, but Snoke has noticed and force pulls the ship back down the ship crashes and Luke stops everyone from dying. He is injured he bonds their mind so Rey has a chance to help Ren. Tells Chewie that he is to fly them to safety while he fights Snoke. Bloodied and battered, mind exhausted from trying to fix a fractured mind Luke steps down from the ship to find Snoke with the Knights of Ren. Snoke starts to use the force to rip the ship apart, Luke stops him the knights attack him while he is occupied. Luke fights valiantly distracting Snoke long enough for Chewie to fly away. Luke distracts them by Luke manages to fight off the knights long enough that Snoke diverts his attention entirely on Luke Force lightning Luke and half the Knights. The knights die, Luke is holding on he feels Chewie, Rey, and Ren are safe. He closes his eyes releases his force blocking the lightning becomes one with the force. The lightning shoots through just his robes, he is gone. It releases a ripple and the lightning loses focus blasting the remaining knights. The universe feels the loss, the rebels who for this whole time were lets say trying to gather allies by letting Fyn talk from the heart about how he broke free of the First order and how the people can rebel. Poe can be off to sabotage something with the other rebels. Just at the climax of Fyns passionate speech with his slightly broken body (looks better if he is still healing to show he is willing to fight even now) that is when Luke dies. So it turns from a moment of hope to a moment of loss. Lea standing by Fyn stops him and approaches the stand. She then tell of how hope can die, hope is often lost. But hope is always deep down in our core, they can smother it, they can try and break us. But only we can truly give up hope. And that with each person who is willing to stand up (camera lingers on Fyn) and for each person who feels they are without hope (camera goes to sleeping Ren) we have to show them that they are not alone (zooms out to include Rey) and that fear and anger (Snoke surrounded my the dead knights) will always lead to isolation and loss. But hope and trust (Poe with their Mcguffin but a crew battle worn and weary) will get us through. Today for me hope has died a death that makes me fear the dark. But (see slight blue light behind her) hope never stays gone for long (Lukes hand creeps into frame and rests on her shoulder). Cut to credits. <br />Disney loves the formula that nothing can be really dark, i mean Palpy should have destroyed so many ships with his lightning but no one even died. And that every dark moment should be followed by comedy or subverting expectations. But Star Wars is a old school story, love, loss, betrayal and human stories that get blow up to larger scale. Introducing to many characters who each get an arc becomes messy, most of them wont go anywhere focus on a core and let others be side characters. Actor complains about small parts remind that there are no small parts just small actors. Number 2 was a mess. So many ways to have fixed it but never fall in love with a first draft.", "textOriginal": "Second movie go to dark lightning planet, Snoke is there, Ren is still bloodied from end of first movie, Rey starts training with Luke (proper training) Ren is put through unnatural and painful rebuilding to focus him to the dark side, his cries of pain echo through the force and reach Rey, she hates him for killing Han.

They enter the planet Luke feels the weight of the dark side pressing on him he says he can feel the dark heart of the planet and tries to heal it. Rey not waiting because of Rens pain rushes off to find him. She finds him undergoing restructuring in a tank. She gets him out to find the liquid burns her and that he was being constantly broken and remade in the tank to strip away his humanity. That\u2019s when Snoke arrives, he awoke the dark side of Ren and the cries for help she felt were his last vestiges trying to be saved. Ren opens up his eyes and they are Sith yellow. Snoke lightnings Rey and tells his apprentice to show off his new power. At that point Luke manages to cut of the dark heart of the planet causing Snoke to fly in a rage and go to find Luke and reconnect to the Core. Rey fights Ren and he overpowers her easily, she runs while trying to reawaken his light side. But he appears more monster then man now, QUIET and ruthless when he gets injured he barely reacts and instead force drains those around him. Rey struggles she is about to fall when she forces open the connection in their mind and it stuns both of them. Luke arrives to find them both twitching on the floor, he gets them to the ship straps them down and starts to fly away, but Snoke has noticed and force pulls the ship back down the ship crashes and Luke stops everyone from dying. He is injured he bonds their mind so Rey has a chance to help Ren. Tells Chewie that he is to fly them to safety while he fights Snoke. Bloodied and battered, mind exhausted from trying to fix a fractured mind Luke steps down from the ship to find Snoke with the Knights of Ren. Snoke starts to use the force to rip the ship apart, Luke stops him the knights attack him while he is occupied. Luke fights valiantly distracting Snoke long enough for Chewie to fly away. Luke distracts them by Luke manages to fight off the knights long enough that Snoke diverts his attention entirely on Luke Force lightning Luke and half the Knights. The knights die, Luke is holding on he feels Chewie, Rey, and Ren are safe. He closes his eyes releases his force blocking the lightning becomes one with the force. The lightning shoots through just his robes, he is gone. It releases a ripple and the lightning loses focus blasting the remaining knights. The universe feels the loss, the rebels who for this whole time were lets say trying to gather allies by letting Fyn talk from the heart about how he broke free of the First order and how the people can rebel. Poe can be off to sabotage something with the other rebels. Just at the climax of Fyns passionate speech with his slightly broken body (looks better if he is still healing to show he is willing to fight even now) that is when Luke dies. So it turns from a moment of hope to a moment of loss. Lea standing by Fyn stops him and approaches the stand. She then tell of how hope can die, hope is often lost. But hope is always deep down in our core, they can smother it, they can try and break us. But only we can truly give up hope. And that with each person who is willing to stand up (camera lingers on Fyn) and for each person who feels they are without hope (camera goes to sleeping Ren) we have to show them that they are not alone (zooms out to include Rey) and that fear and anger (Snoke surrounded my the dead knights) will always lead to isolation and loss. But hope and trust (Poe with their Mcguffin but a crew battle worn and weary) will get us through. Today for me hope has died a death that makes me fear the dark. But (see slight blue light behind her) hope never stays gone for long (Lukes hand creeps into frame and rests on her shoulder). Cut to credits. \nDisney loves the formula that nothing can be really dark, i mean Palpy should have destroyed so many ships with his lightning but no one even died. And that every dark moment should be followed by comedy or subverting expectations. But Star Wars is a old school story, love, loss, betrayal and human stories that get blow up to larger scale. Introducing to many characters who each get an arc becomes messy, most of them wont go anywhere focus on a core and let others be side characters. Actor complains about small parts remind that there are no small parts just small actors. Number 2 was a mess. So many ways to have fixed it but never fall in love with a first draft.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-27T07:14:05.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-27T07:14:05.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 1, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/xMo0RAoUCJ3mIqMV2M7d1jvW2qA\"", "id": "Ugz2Foe2_dNDQlVvuah4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "UZYppNS7mbM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/hR_ot3VN0v3hdPm26pMR1BNVXrE\"", "id": "Ugz2Foe2_dNDQlVvuah4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "sole", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79wlSXeq1Mq8hbVtPYiGirrvwW4UyBD2UXeUw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCviH8SUNcnw4ZDWhm7X5_yQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCviH8SUNcnw4ZDWhm7X5_yQ"}, "videoId": "UZYppNS7mbM", "textDisplay": "I saw this movie bootlegged and walked out of my room", "textOriginal": "I saw this movie bootlegged and walked out of my room", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-27T07:10:58.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-27T07:10:58.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/GzqURuAXVIc7QSWgo6dOr7vQRto\"", "id": "Ugx5Kd2fbZWOeOGVj-d4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "UZYppNS7mbM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/OvC3su7HZjpUl4x8v1o_R43Bxf0\"", "id": "Ugx5Kd2fbZWOeOGVj-d4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Collob Collins", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78c5GnXrRLeC9ra4PnvHdGl6GUPSCbQ_xzK1w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMPt-PjcC3Q3KEp0rtN-sxA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMPt-PjcC3Q3KEp0rtN-sxA"}, "videoId": "UZYppNS7mbM", "textDisplay": "J.J.
