Just to be sure it&#39;s visible. I&#39;m not a habitual poster but seeing you in stress over some unclear matters was not good. I hope some of these points help.<br />--<br />Just a few explainers as a healthcare writer and researcher. Remember these things:\r<br /><br />- you are asymptomatic. That means you have no symptoms yet. You may never get symptoms. Hospital is for the sick--not the &#39;positive&#39;, so there is no conspiracy theory or rat in evidence; this is standard medical procedure to separate you away from the hospital and see if you do get symptoms or not. It is a very good thing if you are NOT going off to hospital as they consider you not sick. : )<br /><br />- remember everyone&#39;s immune response is different. You two should have a good immune system due to the amount of travel you do. So testing positive doesn&#39;t mean you will get sick. You will (should) have good coronavirus antibodies (though not yet to this new strain)--but your bodies will be used to fighting off viruses from overseas so have some faith your little white cells are doing everything you have trained them to do!<br /><br />- don&#39;t panic. Stress is what lowers immune response. Easy for anyone to say, I know--but stay keen to look after your health and use all facilities available. Refusing Japanese food is not the way. : )<br /><br />- keep your lymphatic system working by moving around when you can. Light on-the-spot exercise and tai chi will help you keep the lymph draining and this helps to fight infection. Optimal lymphatic drainage depends on not being immobile and this will keep the immune system well. <br /><br />- Japan has extremely high medical care standards and will do a good job of quarantine and procedures. Thank heavens you are in a very good healthcare system over there--it is one of the best in the world. This health service will do it right. You will be monitored ongoing by professionals but there are fewer medical staff at the various quarantine centres merely because the people there are asymptomatic (no symptoms). The people in quarantine are, however, under observation.<br /><br />There will be trained medical staff to assess and triage cases who turn from no symptoms to having symptoms--and it&#39;s these personnel who will decide who gets moved to a medical ward in a hospital.<br /><br />Many people will have tested positive and are not sick and won&#39;t get sick. We carry all manner of viruses in our bodies at all times--only &#39;some&#39; people get sick and you may well not be &#39;some people&#39;! You travel a lot and so your immunity is likely to be good--even taking into account your added health challenges such as diabetes and gluten intolerance.<br /><br />Many people&#39;s immunity is well equipped to fight off new viruses. This varies person to person. So, testing positive means nothing as an indicator of whether you stay well. (To stay well, stay away from hospitals--they are full of very sick people. That sounds amusing but... really, that&#39;s when people get sick. They go into hospitals for routine things and come out worse than they went in).<br /><br />There were 99 positives on the Princess Diamond 2 days ago--and there will have been more since. Of these, only a small % will be needing hospitalisation and just as anywhere else, the beds are kept for the sick and symptomatic due to bed demand. Remember also, the world has other medical emergencies: hospitals need beds for all their usual roster of patients also! The other emergencies and routine rosters cannot stop just because of this damn virus... unfortunately.<br /><br />They won&#39;t want wards choked up with people who &quot;might&quot; get sick but who as yet are not.\r<br /><br />- a Japanese &#39;hostel&#39; may be a matter of poor Japanese-speakers&#39; word choice. This will be a designated quarantine centre. The Japanese use the word &#39;hostel&#39; for accommodation of many types. Whatever it comprises, cultural differences will account for why there are big differences between the UK and Japan but it will be clean, hygienic and you&#39;ll be monitored and fed well.<br /><br />- the accommodation may be without certain Western facilities such as great WiFi as quarantine areas in Japan tend to be rural in many cases. They are, as a nation, less glued to their p[hones esp. in rural areas.<br /><br />- if you show symptoms later, you&#39;ll be relocated to a place that may be (though not necessarily) better equipped for social media. But till then, try and take this as simply a cultural difference.<br /><br />- if you don&#39;t develop symptoms within a given time, you&#39;ll be released just as your pal Allan Steele was. Till then, you are just under watch for symptoms for everyone&#39;s protection including yours. So, try and do all you can to keep that upbeat nature and to eat and drink what is offered (see caveats below).\r<br /><br />**\r<br />NOTES &amp; CLARIFICATIONS\r<br /><br />A positive test won&#39;t put you into hospital until you are showing symptoms (symptomatic). While asymptomatic, people will only be observed to see what develops, and retested every X days. Hospitals are overwhelmed and are full of people who have symptoms! You do not want to be in that depressing place until one of you gets symptoms.\r (People usually get admitted to hospital for respiratory issues only when needing intervention such as a respirator, oxygen, and so on). <br /><br />Your coughs <b>may</b> be decided to be symptoms but that&#39;s for medics to determine.\r<br />Now, in any case, you need to watch for symptoms and eat and drink to your best ability.\r<br /><br />As everyone is already infected (in your test group of people showing positive), keeping you separate from other patients will not be essential since you all each have it already--keeping you separate won&#39;t prevent what&#39;s already happened. It&#39;s too late to use masks and so on to hope for no transmission--since the transmission has already occurred.\r<br /><br />But I repeat--testing positive and not showing symptoms may well be good. I.e. it may indicate your immune response is fighting off the virus and therefore, no symptoms. Do all you both can to feed your immune system with the nutrients it needs and worry less about where you are.\r<br /><br />What should be happening now is that those who test positive are kept away from non-positives and that core hygiene measure are followed--the handwashing, mask-wearing etc will be to protect others not yet infected more than to protect you from each other.\r<br /><br /><br />Wear your masks properly. Glasses wearers should fit masks UNDER not over a spectacle frame... so the fabric should not have been sitting atop your glasses lenses in the earlier images. This helps you not pass this to health workers.\r<br /><br />In terms of yourselves--you need to eat and drink even when not feeling like it. It is a little like saying &quot;eat your greens&quot; to youngsters. They hate the greens but the greens are needed. This is metaphorical: what I am saying is, put aside thoughts of foods you do not fancy and eat it anyway unless it is against your dietary requirements for diabetes control, gluten-free etc. <br /><br />Japanese food is usually very healthy and focuses on fresh and soups, etc.\r<br /><br />I also would not find it my taste--in fact, the thought of sushi (as an example) turns me off--but in a crisis, it is like pinching your nose and swallowing a medicine. Do it knowing it is appreciated by the body. You may need to acclimatise to foreign food a little anyway and that is normal, so some loose stool, diarrhoea etc is not a matter for panic--and you will get used to it and accrue nutrients from it. I&#39;d also accept anything vegan and vegetable-based, plant diets and vitamins and trace minerals. <br /><br />If in doubt, ask can they obtain Nissin noodles--these are dried ramen but they are quality ones compared to the ones we usually eat--they&#39;re often nutrient-rich. You would have the broth and avoid the noodles due to your gluten intolerance. <br /><br />Check also for other noodle soup bases that have very good nutrient components or drink any broths offered but decline noodles themselves. The mix of ingredients differs from pack to pack of course--some may well be unsuitable for you full stop--because of carbs (sugars) or because of gluten, but the ranges are wide and some are based on chicken stock, some on fish stock, etc. <br /><br />These are not like Batchelors Supernoodles! They are extremely healthy if you choose the right one (I love &#39;spicy&#39;) and can give you a lot of what you need. Plus, some have plenty of chili which fights infection and reduces inflammation. Whatever your diet needs, there will be excellent Japanese noodle soup bases that meet the diet requirements. I recommend Nissin as I know them well. Not Niss*a*n--those are way too big to swallow. :D (No, not even the Micra...gets stuck in the gullet.)\r<br /><br />Packs of Nissin noodles that are Japanese and thus of the highest quality and ingredients are available on Amazon. You can self-order. I&#39;m not suggesting you live on them but have as a reserve--they warm the body and make you feel better as well as ensuring your digestive system, organs and brain have something to live on if you&#39;re too picky to accept the other Japanese foods. (Try to accept...)<br /><br />Of course, as mentioned above, stay away from the things you know are against your dietary restrictions--that&#39;s another matter.<br /><br />Try not to let suspicion and paranoia set in--the Japanese government will absolutely not be trying to make you disappear. It all sounds like normal quarantine protocol.\r<br /><br />What I can say is that keeping people on the ship was a silly idea. Whoever came up with that one needs to walk the plank.\r<br /><br />Should you wish to contact me, (you or Steve, or the family) you are welcome to drop a line here; there are things I would like to pass on (no pun intended) which don&#39;t belong in public.\r<br />For now, don&#39;t be too stressed--you are away from that ship which clearly was culturing all sorts of things! :) <br /><br />The Japanese will do a better job than that. Go with the flow--it will help you stay healthier and with a better immune response.", "textOriginal": "Hello David Abel, Sally, Steve et al. \n\nI am copying here what I posted to one of your last comments on Facebook (David).

It is a very good thing if you are NOT going off to hospital as they consider you not sick. : )\n\n- remember everyone's immune response is different. You two should have a good immune system due to the amount of travel you do. So testing positive doesn't mean you will get sick. You will (should) have good coronavirus antibodies (though not yet to this new strain)--but your bodies will be used to fighting off viruses from overseas so have some faith your little white cells are doing everything you have trained them to do!\n\n- don't panic. Stress is what lowers immune response. Easy for anyone to say, I know--but stay keen to look after your health and use all facilities available. Refusing Japanese food is not the way. : )\n\n- keep your lymphatic system working by moving around when you can. Light on-the-spot exercise and tai chi will help you keep the lymph draining and this helps to fight infection. Optimal lymphatic drainage depends on not being immobile and this will keep the immune system well. \n\n- Japan has extremely high medical care standards and will do a good job of quarantine and procedures. Thank heavens you are in a very good healthcare system over there--it is one of the best in the world. This health service will do it right. You will be monitored ongoing by professionals but there are fewer medical staff at the various quarantine centres merely because the people there are asymptomatic (no symptoms). The people in quarantine are, however, under observation.\n\nThere will be trained medical staff to assess and triage cases who turn from no symptoms to having symptoms--and it's these personnel who will decide who gets moved to a medical ward in a hospital.\n\nMany people will have tested positive and are not sick and won't get sick. We carry all manner of viruses in our bodies at all times--only 'some' people get sick and you may well not be 'some people'! You travel a lot and so your immunity is likely to be good--even taking into account your added health challenges such as diabetes and gluten intolerance.\n\nMany people's immunity is well equipped to fight off new viruses. This varies person to person. So, testing positive means nothing as an indicator of whether you stay well. (To stay well, stay away from hospitals--they are full of very sick people. That sounds amusing but... really, that's when people get sick. They go into hospitals for routine things and come out worse than they went in).\n\nThere were 99 positives on the Princess Diamond 2 days ago--and there will have been more since. Of these, only a small % will be needing hospitalisation and just as anywhere else, the beds are kept for the sick and symptomatic due to bed demand. Remember also, the world has other medical emergencies: hospitals need beds for all their usual roster of patients also! The other emergencies and routine rosters cannot stop just because of this damn virus... unfortunately.\n\nThey won't want wards choked up with people who \"might\" get sick but who as yet are not.\r\n\n- a Japanese 'hostel' may be a matter of poor Japanese-speakers' word choice. This will be a designated quarantine centre. The Japanese use the word 'hostel' for accommodation of many types. Whatever it comprises, cultural differences will account for why there are big differences between the UK and Japan but it will be clean, hygienic and you'll be monitored and fed well.\n\n- the accommodation may be without certain Western facilities such as great WiFi as quarantine areas in Japan tend to be rural in many cases. They are, as a nation, less glued to their p[hones esp. in rural areas.\n\n- if you show symptoms later, you'll be relocated to a place that may be (though not necessarily) better equipped for social media. But till then, try and take this as simply a cultural difference.\n\n- if you don't develop symptoms within a given time, you'll be released just as your pal Allan Steele was. Till then, you are just under watch for symptoms for everyone's protection including yours. So, try and do all you can to keep that upbeat nature and to eat and drink what is offered (see caveats below).\r\n\n**\r\nNOTES & CLARIFICATIONS\r\n\nA positive test won't put you into hospital until you are showing symptoms (symptomatic). While asymptomatic, people will only be observed to see what develops, and retested every X days. Hospitals are overwhelmed and are full of people who have symptoms! You do not want to be in that depressing place until one of you gets symptoms.\r (People usually get admitted to hospital for respiratory issues only when needing intervention such as a respirator, oxygen, and so on). \n\nYour coughs *may* be decided to be symptoms but that's for medics to determine.\r\nNow, in any case, you need to watch for symptoms and eat and drink to your best ability.\r\n\nAs everyone is already infected (in your test group of people showing positive), keeping you separate from other patients will not be essential since you all each have it already--keeping you separate won't prevent what's already happened. It's too late to use masks and so on to hope for no transmission--since the transmission has already occurred.\r\n\nBut I repeat--testing positive and not showing symptoms may well be good. I.e. it may indicate your immune response is fighting off the virus and therefore, no symptoms. Do all you both can to feed your immune system with the nutrients it needs and worry less about where you are.\r\n\nWhat should be happening now is that those who test positive are kept away from non-positives and that core hygiene measure are followed--the handwashing, mask-wearing etc will be to protect others not yet infected more than to protect you from each other.\r\n\n\nWear your masks properly. Glasses wearers should fit masks UNDER not over a spectacle frame... so the fabric should not have been sitting atop your glasses lenses in the earlier images. This helps you not pass this to health workers.\r\n\nIn terms of yourselves--you need to eat and drink even when not feeling like it. It is a little like saying \"eat your greens\" to youngsters. They hate the greens but the greens are needed. This is metaphorical: what I am saying is, put aside thoughts of foods you do not fancy and eat it anyway unless it is against your dietary requirements for diabetes control, gluten-free etc. \n\nJapanese food is usually very healthy and focuses on fresh and soups, etc.\r\n\nI also would not find it my taste--in fact, the thought of sushi (as an example) turns me off--but in a crisis, it is like pinching your nose and swallowing a medicine. Do it knowing it is appreciated by the body. You may need to acclimatise to foreign food a little anyway and that is normal, so some loose stool, diarrhoea etc is not a matter for panic--and you will get used to it and accrue nutrients from it. I'd also accept anything vegan and vegetable-based, plant diets and vitamins and trace minerals. \n\nIf in doubt, ask can they obtain Nissin noodles--these are dried ramen but they are quality ones compared to the ones we usually eat--they're often nutrient-rich. You would have the broth and avoid the noodles due to your gluten intolerance. \n\nCheck also for other noodle soup bases that have very good nutrient components or drink any broths offered but decline noodles themselves. The mix of ingredients differs from pack to pack of course--some may well be unsuitable for you full stop--because of carbs (sugars) or because of gluten, but the ranges are wide and some are based on chicken stock, some on fish stock, etc. \n\nThese are not like Batchelors Supernoodles! They are extremely healthy if you choose the right one (I love 'spicy') and can give you a lot of what you need. Plus, some have plenty of chili which fights infection and reduces inflammation. Whatever your diet needs, there will be excellent Japanese noodle soup bases that meet the diet requirements. I recommend Nissin as I know them well. Not Niss*a*n--those are way too big to swallow. :D (No, not even the Micra...gets stuck in the gullet.)\r\n\nPacks of Nissin noodles that are Japanese and thus of the highest quality and ingredients are available on Amazon. You can self-order. I'm not suggesting you live on them but have as a reserve--they warm the body and make you feel better as well as ensuring your digestive system, organs and brain have something to live on if you're too picky to accept the other Japanese foods. (Try to accept...)\n\nOf course, as mentioned above, stay away from the things you know are against your dietary restrictions--that's another matter.\n\nTry not to let suspicion and paranoia set in--the Japanese government will absolutely not be trying to make you disappear. It all sounds like normal quarantine protocol.\r\n\nWhat I can say is that keeping people on the ship was a silly idea. Whoever came up with that one needs to walk the plank.\r\n\nShould you wish to contact me, (you or Steve, or the family) you are welcome to drop a line here; there are things I would like to pass on (no pun intended) which don't belong in public.\r\nFor now, don't be too stressed--you are away from that ship which clearly was culturing all sorts of things! :) \n\nThe Japanese will do a better job than that. Go with the flow--it will help you stay healthier and with a better immune response.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 10, "publishedAt": "2020-02-18T15:08:47.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-18T16:23:39.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 5, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/3Qb5PCyebPxyjsrfscNeMUij9Sw\"", "id": "UgzbRuGJW6vGCVoyuRx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "jSpW2SbsZ3I", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/H83h0bXbHE-Z_-litoKFCw7g3UU\"", "id": "UgzbRuGJW6vGCVoyuRx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Ridge Wood", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_GbbmPlvG_8HW5k3ZkHI3dN_gIj_sCc-kxOg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCf-ID1krldZJzy27AEfa8w", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCf-ID1krldZJzy27AEfa8w"}, "videoId": "jSpW2SbsZ3I", "textDisplay": "LOVE from Texas \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "textOriginal": "LOVE from Texas \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-18T15:06:11.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-18T15:06:11.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/i8BMTQUV5wRkUGjCaXNKkPbs7fU\"", "id": "UgxRMOtBiX4RloZUTLh4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "jSpW2SbsZ3I", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/SxWu414xwst8A2TM9U0-JL2cwcY\"", "id": "UgxRMOtBiX4RloZUTLh4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Traci Goodbar", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79EynWoN4MMj1nl8nyR4_REXEMh2OIUope5og=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB1b0ffqQPtLum3F2S8ZTVQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCB1b0ffqQPtLum3F2S8ZTVQ"}, "videoId": "jSpW2SbsZ3I", "textDisplay": "Hoping that David and Salley or their son Steve will have time for a quick update in this format to confirm or correct that face book post!", "textOriginal": "Hoping that David and Salley or their son Steve will have time for a quick update in this format to confirm or correct that face book post!", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-18T15:06:05.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-18T15:06:05.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/DgkTqPSgOpye_HXH73j-F8wCUwI\"", "id": "UgzwGBZ1sDLhzCprT9J4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "jSpW2SbsZ3I", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/XwQ0t68eOLi7zGgTEts-w8Mx3hY\"", "id": "UgzwGBZ1sDLhzCprT9J4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "PeterMorifan", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79ZQ5pMnPy6rYLBPYl9eTrpAjXSoExIYt_yWw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrBlqUh0S7j_-yb7gilgYIg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrBlqUh0S7j_-yb7gilgYIg"}, "videoId": "jSpW2SbsZ3I", "textDisplay": "Truly admire,your love for each other,and for humanity,hopefully very soon,this damn U.K. government will come to their senses soon,and help you both,and other brits,get back home soon.", "textOriginal": "Truly admire,your love for each other,and for humanity,hopefully very soon,this damn U.K. government will come to their senses soon,and help you both,and other brits,get back home soon.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-18T15:04:28.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-18T15:04:28.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/xCpNHL1K2dZaWhLEY9gQAgfgU7Y\"", "id": "UgwgP8zZhTyfb317dL54AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "jSpW2SbsZ3I", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/2Qt3ybwgt6ZSQm7ryTSIGQGaqd8\"", "id": "UgwgP8zZhTyfb317dL54AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "DEE.
