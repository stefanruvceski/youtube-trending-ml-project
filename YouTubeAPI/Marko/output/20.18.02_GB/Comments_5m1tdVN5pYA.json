At the end of the day it appears that she conducted a vicious and sustained assault using a potentially deadly weapon upon an unsuspecting victim. She ought to have faced the consequences for this as anyone else should and would be expected to.\n\nIn my opinion, it appears that Ms Flack was someone who has spent their life mostly insulated from the negative consequences of her actions and unfortunately when she actually had to face the music she was unable to handle it - because she hadn't had to deal with negative consequences as much as the average person, she was unable to develop appropriate coping strategies for when things went wrong. However, this is mostly not actually her fault (it takes others to excuse people from their bad actions) which is why we want to label her as a victim despite being directly responsible for the circumstances that led to her suicide.\n\nWe'll all sigh and say \"oh dear\", we'll find a scapegoat to blame and wash our hands of it and salve our souls, but we won't learn any lessons unfortunately (See also Grenfell).", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-17T13:21:51.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-17T13:25:30.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/9Z4DDnFcoyd2YeCjeahX8mpUkdA\"", "id": "Ugw8aftxL-1c85B50PJ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "5m1tdVN5pYA", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/xfmwx7SHmRlrNAHKqB-MA7lPq2U\"", "id": "Ugw8aftxL-1c85B50PJ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Alex Hall", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_QOXkL2OX-G8Kk-8gzrnoKoDky_VF8jUBJ6g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC77ksJDnuByRXtSBxsm8cmQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC77ksJDnuByRXtSBxsm8cmQ"}, "videoId": "5m1tdVN5pYA", "textDisplay": "Anyone holding a female to standards or consequences you are evil!", "textOriginal": "Anyone holding a female to standards or consequences you are evil!", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2020-02-17T13:18:55.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-17T13:18:55.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/Utg7hUj2lm_K-ur0eZteIsDaeYs\"", "id": "UgxOK3YgI0jNoVtJDNp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "5m1tdVN5pYA", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/Ak6SoaxZyHNbnxFpHZ19-GyW_Us\"", "id": "UgxOK3YgI0jNoVtJDNp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Steven Hyde", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-K_siwLFpCSKny6X0vFB1_LQlQ14pVNPubQA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjnnsr1qdK2PiPjaQO6csYA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjnnsr1qdK2PiPjaQO6csYA"}, "videoId": "5m1tdVN5pYA", "textDisplay": "She was a domestic abuser.
