While I enjoyed TFA, I felt it was a bit of a rehash with new and compelling characters and ideas, but TLJ straight up challenged convention and turned the entire franchise and what we think of heroes on their ears. Rian made bold decisions, with the exception of one (I am not fond of the Canto Bight sequence either), and regardless of whether it was to serve the purposes of his proposed new trilogy or the mere fact it was a creative visionary trying to push the boundaries of what we know SW to be, bringing JJ back was a mistake. <br /><br />Also, why announce the Emperor in the trailers and the crawl?! Even if he was to be the big bad, that could\u2019ve been an \u201coh shit\u201d moment that got flushed. Major faux pas. Also, JJ/Terrio should\u2019ve had enough faith in Kylo as a character to be the primary villain post-Snoke.

While I enjoyed TFA, I felt it was a bit of a rehash with new and compelling characters and ideas, but TLJ straight up challenged convention and turned the entire franchise and what we think of heroes on their ears. Rian made bold decisions, with the exception of one (I am not fond of the Canto Bight sequence either), and regardless of whether it was to serve the purposes of his proposed new trilogy or the mere fact it was a creative visionary trying to push the boundaries of what we know SW to be, bringing JJ back was a mistake. \n\nAlso, why announce the Emperor in the trailers and the crawl?!
