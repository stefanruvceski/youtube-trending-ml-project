Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! One day, Beck received a message from her friend about someone she should add on social media. Beck didn't know the person, but her friend told her that if she connected with him, he would give her free money online. Beck decided to go for it - the idea of free money got her really excited. When she added the man, he started messaging her and offering her money right away. He promised to treat her right, but then he started asking her weird questions. He asked her for her shoe size, height, age - lots of personal details about Beck. Beck responded, but she gave him fake information. Then, the man asked Beck for inappropriate pictures she wasn't comfortable with. When she denied his request, he responded by saying that he would still give her the money if she sent his profile to 5 of her friends that were girls - they HAD to be girls. The promise of free money was too hard for her to pass up, so she sent his information to some friends. Some of her friends thought it was sketchy and didn't add him, but some of them did. When it was time for Beck to get the money he promised her, he asked her for her address. Then, at that moment, Beck made a big mistake - she sent him her REAL address. Beck's friends freaked out and started telling him that her address was fake, which made him extremely angry. He started sending Beck scary, threatening messages. At that point, Beck realized she made a huge mistake. Beck decided to show her school officer the messages and screen shots, and Beck's school decided to call the police. Beck was even more upset when the police told her that the man she was talking to was likely a criminal, and the whole situation was really scary for her. She regretted giving out any personal information, and the entire experience taught her what it means to stay safe online.When she looks back now, she can say to herself, A stranger offered me money on social media - and it taught me an important lesson.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

It's delicious. Especially when you learn to make this simple recipe yourself. Or when you manipulate a friend to make beef chili for you. Also, beans.

Break it up in the pan then let it sit until a crust starts to form, then flip and do the same thing again Dice a large onion and chop it up Do the same with three cloves of garlicHeat your chili pot on medium with some olive oil then sauté the onion until it starts to brownThrow the garlic in during the last couple of minutesThen add the beef with a teaspoon of salt and break it up moreAdd in 28oz/790g crushed tomatoes2 tablespoon chili powder1 tablespoon cumin 1 to 1.5 cups beef broth…adjust as necessary ½ tablespoon of brown sugar15.5oz/439g chatty bastard kidney beansThen add hot sauce or more spice as desired. Then add toppings, which don’t count as chili ingredients, because they are on top, not inside. They’re not really a part of the chili. The chili is it’s own thing. It’s like calling ketchup a hot dog. Ketchup isn’t a hot dog. It’s ketchup. It has it’s own life. Don’t argue with me here. It will get you nowhere and it will just waste both of our times. Especially if you’re right."

After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy’s top aviators, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: “Rooster,” the son of Maverick’s late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka “Goose.” Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.

Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. This led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   But the big picture conceals  the details. Let us look at one region in particular: Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. So is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?
