Personally i feel that we havent done enough to freshen up. Werid saying that considering we have only lost 1 game, but seriously when is the last game we can look to for a <b>Proper</b> good performance? Sheffield Utd would be the one I go for. That was 2 months ago. Leicester 4-0 and then Everton 5-2 and City 3-1. They would be the only games I can look to and say &quot;Yeah we played really well&quot;. Like how many times have we had to hear commentators this season saying &quot;Liverpool not really hitting their stride&quot; or &quot;Not a vintage Liverpool performance&quot; or something along the lines of that? Because for me it seems to be every other week. <br />But back to the point about freshness. Firmino&#39;s last goal at anfield was 10 and a half months ago. I know he is not an out and out goalscorer and brings alot to the team, but has he been recently? I say he hasnt. When teams sit back, which they have to now, he has to drop so deep its like having 4 in the midfield. Now put Aguero in that same team, he can have 3 players around him and still smash a goal in from anywhere around the box. I am in no way trying to have a go at bobby, but for the moment his contribution is seriously starting to be hurt because he cant operate against teams with a double low block. Maybe a Timo Werner is exactly what we need at the minute, someone who can spin and smash a goal from nothing. As for Salah, good god I have no idea what has happened to him, he is attempting 1.6 dribbles per match and has a succes rate of 56%. In 17/18 he attempted 2.3 dribbles per match with a success rate of 64%. I looked that up after last night because I have noticed more and more he isnt taking people on, he gets the ball into feet and just tries to shield it and ends up losing the ball most of the time and, considering we know how good of a dribbler he is, i think his form is the most frustrating at the minute. <br />But I will say this, I dont know if I am crazy or not, but ever since Klopp first took over, everytime there is an international, or break of any kind, we always take a few weeks where we are crap. I think 16/17 is the best example of it where we had just beaten Watford 6-1 at Anfield and were soaring in the clouds, top of the league and smashing in goals for fun. Came back after an international, drew with southampton, were very unconvincing against sunderland then lost to Bournemouth and drew with West Ham. And I have noticed this each season with Klopp so maybe there is something deeper. <br />Am I daring to attack Klopp? Good god no. The man has done more for this club than the last 6 managers combined and I know how sour i sound at the moment, but I am just very concerned as to the sustainability of our current team when they are churning out more bog standard performances than good ones. Personally the most entertaining season I have ever witnessed was 2017/18, with 2013/14 coming a close second. But the amount of absolutely brilliant performances that were coming from all over the pitch was just breathtaking, the only thing costing us that year was just so many individual mistakes. Now it just feels like a chore to watch us play alot of the time. I am not saying I would trade this season for another 17/18, I mean we are about to win the fckn Premier League for the first time in my lifetime, I just am worried that we may be in for another collapse, like 2014/15.", "textOriginal": "Allison - Fine \nRobbo - I dont know what happened to him, but everytime he got the ball he slowed it down and was always looking to pass the ball back into the middle.
