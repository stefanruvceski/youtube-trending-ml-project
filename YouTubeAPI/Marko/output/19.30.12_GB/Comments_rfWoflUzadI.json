However,  I&#39;m not willing to cut it the same slack I did for movies like Venom because the extenuating circumstances were entirely of their own making.  Pretty good is a far cry from what it should&#39;ve been had the whole trilogy been handled properly, &amp; it&#39;s even worse when looked at in the context of the rest of the sequel trilogy, &amp; the rest of the franchise.  By all rights, this movie should&#39;ve been bigger than Endgame, &amp; the best we got was a decent enough film that had to move at 100 miles an hour in order to get through all the story &amp; exposition we needed because it has basically no connection to anything that came before it.  I&#39;m glad it undid so much of the Last Jedi, but I also wouldn&#39;t say it feels at all like a follow up to the Force Awakens, either.  I didn&#39;t get the impression that much of anything that played out in this movie had been at all set up by either of the previous movies, which is why it has so much exposition to get through.

However,  I'm not willing to cut it the same slack I did for movies like Venom because the extenuating circumstances were entirely of their own making.  Pretty good is a far cry from what it should've been had the whole trilogy been handled properly, & it's even worse when looked at in the context of the rest of the sequel trilogy, & the rest of the franchise.  By all rights, this movie should've been bigger than Endgame, & the best we got was a decent enough film that had to move at 100 miles an hour in order to get through all the story & exposition we needed because it has basically no connection to anything that came before it.

So even if Ben was redeemed, as Supreme Leader he was arguable worse then the Empire because in the EU stuff between films his police is destroy any planet who makes even slight contact with the Resistance. He can\u2019t just get off scot free. He would have ended up in galactic jail or executed. Something like that. He needed to die like Anakin for logistical reasons.
