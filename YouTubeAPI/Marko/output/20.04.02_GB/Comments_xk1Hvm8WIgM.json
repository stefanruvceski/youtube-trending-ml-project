Sw/Sh before release was going to fail the needs of collectors and it makes sense for those people to boycott the game, however their reasoning fell upon deaf ears of the competitors and explorers that come to play Pokemon, so there wasn't any unanimous agreement on whether this was going to negatively impact Sw/Sh as a whole, which said agreement is crucial to any effective political or social movement. That's not to say that collectors shouldn't have voiced their opinions on the game, quite the opposite actually, but I think the notion of a boycott sparked counter protest in the form of the large sales numbers we see today. \n\n\n\nSo while yes it is important for those rallying for a boycott to keep their word, in some cases a fan base might be too large for a boycott to even matter. I think the best ways for people to not monetarily support games on social media nowadays is to not give them free press/attention, avoiding showing anger in opt for disappointment, and to offer attractive alternatives to the games we love instead.\n\n\n\nSo tl;dr, Play Temtem.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-04T13:18:45.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-04T13:18:45.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/4KsH2vKf3b-L6gecgMb3gL4EfdM\"", "id": "UgzcNQudP4FI_niULSV4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "xk1Hvm8WIgM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/Ehi2d3tgf5Hg9D0l0ezzEp8zhdw\"", "id": "UgzcNQudP4FI_niULSV4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Professor Dragonite", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-Ipir5gr3JJmVSPZT5nAjiXP5FvCZRTe6dYw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI5_T8GDlltIZ1aFI2vhM6A", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCI5_T8GDlltIZ1aFI2vhM6A"}, "videoId": "xk1Hvm8WIgM", "textDisplay": "Thing is, the vocal minority is just that: a minority.", "textOriginal": "Thing is, the vocal minority is just that: a minority.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 2, "publishedAt": "2020-02-04T13:17:24.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-04T13:17:24.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/cMUy0UQjGtKPrPToEDUqkW6Z5_g\"", "id": "UgyRYzr17Jde5Ff8ebF4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "xk1Hvm8WIgM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/uKn00ZcDZWhu00u4cvLmYXmij64\"", "id": "UgyRYzr17Jde5Ff8ebF4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Sir Amic Varze", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79eTWLjIUxcyXDp6LbAiRkDjpAYTQz9sZ4H-g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0N0nwglltqtG7CvF8ipY6Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0N0nwglltqtG7CvF8ipY6Q"}, "videoId": "xk1Hvm8WIgM", "textDisplay": "I&#39;ve always thought this show needed more Vaas.", "textOriginal": "I've always thought this show needed more Vaas.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-04T13:09:17.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-04T13:09:17.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/OFLabfYvGuTPjPHJAQabyzBFtFs\"", "id": "UgwSKKQ29fCg9AnJs8R4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "xk1Hvm8WIgM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/SRyNmi4Yu2DdZBYSoX8m8Ma8Q6s\"", "id": "UgwSKKQ29fCg9AnJs8R4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "ScabeiathraxUK", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79rzh89IT0ZLUedUhm8r_-M2t46Rri_QNzymQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeeRvzk2juM4zyrgPOLtPjA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeeRvzk2juM4zyrgPOLtPjA"}, "videoId": "xk1Hvm8WIgM", "textDisplay": "People keep assigning the failure of &quot;Gamer Boycotts&quot; to people complaining and then buying the game anyway; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what it is. <br /><br /><br />I think the outrage is real and that the people who are outraged (I mean beyond expressing their outrage by a single click, like joining a steam group) often don&#39;t buy the game, but there&#39;s three major problems with turning the boycott into success:<br /><br /><br />1) Advertising the boycott advertises the product, as a quote in the video mentioned, increasing brand/product awareness and catching new potential customers.<br />2) Even the expressions of anger with the most agreement (like the Battlefront 2 reddit post, most downvoted in history) are too small to make a difference.
