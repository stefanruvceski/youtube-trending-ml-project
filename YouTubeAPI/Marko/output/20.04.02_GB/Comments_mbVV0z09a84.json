Louis\u2019 team is so fucked with these kind of interviews or the ones made by the sun where they always have those \"exclusive\" things about their friendship and always ask him about Zayn when in this video Louis looks sad when he talks about him when I thought he will be answering mad like he sounds in those interviews.  Adding that Zayn never responds to that seems like there are more things going on. And bet Zayn knows. Also friendships have ups and downs... sad how those people never have had any friends to know this.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-04T17:00:08.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-04T17:00:08.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/YkrkB8ZNp0UL5IMh4uqgZG-XKLk\"", "id": "Ugyp5xgC6l3CJXyOndt4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "mbVV0z09a84", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/4c5J8o-ROCglZX-vdvGW9PkpjHY\"", "id": "Ugyp5xgC6l3CJXyOndt4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Phan Stylinson", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-ENHsyjsIbkw86PGb7Oheleg2nrW3KHAb9Mg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTdSumYaMMWPlZv5627qXdw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTdSumYaMMWPlZv5627qXdw"}, "videoId": "mbVV0z09a84", "textDisplay": "At least do your research before conducting a goddamn interview", "textOriginal": "At least do your research before conducting a goddamn interview", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-04T16:54:16.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-04T16:54:16.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/dYm_VE0fikuRlV5bhzYcw7DviB8\"", "id": "Ugx7NCKAqPv38LYuUbZ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "mbVV0z09a84", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/DQW6sHZdf5e1XnC8lTm_YnQbIPI\"", "id": "Ugx7NCKAqPv38LYuUbZ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Alexandra Tayler", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-vpjLLxsz9LvROi9spJ43ezCo4XRHf_oiwPw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAzitgWWy-g17hPUmwpCfYA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAzitgWWy-g17hPUmwpCfYA"}, "videoId": "mbVV0z09a84", "textDisplay": "Did you even listen to the album?

Well, after listening I can tell that his song TWO OF US is not all about him and his grief but for the people who have same situation like him and you can feel his sincerity and emotion.. Most of you, really misunderstands him... losing loved ones is not really easy. Most of you really don&#39;t see its purpose.

And I can really tell that this album really show the world his talent and capabilities as an artist especially his ability to convey emotions and positive messages through lyrics. I just don&#39;t get it why these people really wants to spread negativity about him especially after his hard work and dedication to his album.

I really understands why he&#39;s offended by it cos he\u2019s just proud of his work but these people just ruined it for him and didn&#39;t give what he deserves for his hard work. Again, I think the real problem is that they just TOO FOCUS on the grief issue and really didn&#39;t give this guy a time to fully heal and recover from the lost cos his sister just passed away last year. Okay, some of you really wants to know more about it, but there&#39;s no need to rush when the time is right it will happen.. give him a time cos I really think he deserves space and the interview about his grief is really a wrong timing topic.
