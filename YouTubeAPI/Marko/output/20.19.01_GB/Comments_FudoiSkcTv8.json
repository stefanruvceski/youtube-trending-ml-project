Its still very tough, because one to one conversational therapy is something you need to pay for by yourself. But everything physical except dental issues is provided by the state. This makes it very easy for us as citizens to go for checkups and call on help from our primary care doctors. Our Primary care doctors are as all other doctors trained in therapeutic conversations and use of medicine for psychiatric purposes. <br /><br />In my case, I pay for my own therapist, I find it works better for me than the group therapy programmes provided by the state. My primary care doctor, however was the first to see the signs of anxiety and get me on medication that instantly helped me. She follows up once every three months and changes my medication depending on my needs, she follows me very closely in my medicinal use, making sure I dont get an addiction or lose control. Furthermore she always takes her time, listening to what I go through with my therapist and providing holistic counsel taking into account my daughter, my husband, my studies and the general realities of life - reminding me what is normal, and what is not. During rough times I use both my therapist and my doctor, but during less hard times, my doctor is more than adequate in handling my therapeutic consults.<br />My husband had a depression, but never went to therapy, because it was a mild depression. He was prescribed antidepressants and consults with his doctor every 2 weeks, a few months later and he had worked through it.

Its still very tough, because one to one conversational therapy is something you need to pay for by yourself. But everything physical except dental issues is provided by the state. This makes it very easy for us as citizens to go for checkups and call on help from our primary care doctors. Our Primary care doctors are as all other doctors trained in therapeutic conversations and use of medicine for psychiatric purposes. \n\nIn my case, I pay for my own therapist, I find it works better for me than the group therapy programmes provided by the state. My primary care doctor, however was the first to see the signs of anxiety and get me on medication that instantly helped me. She follows up once every three months and changes my medication depending on my needs, she follows me very closely in my medicinal use, making sure I dont get an addiction or lose control. Furthermore she always takes her time, listening to what I go through with my therapist and providing holistic counsel taking into account my daughter, my husband, my studies and the general realities of life - reminding me what is normal, and what is not.

I can do this at will at doesn't affect my daily activities unless the object is more than 10 cms away.  but these days I can see double images if I get too tired or I'm feeling too sleepy and I really have to focus to get back to the normal image. and the strange thing is I only see double images of things which are less than approximately 50 cms and the objects farther away just seem blurry, when I went to a doctor he told me I was making stuff up because I gave my personal experience regarding my condition (as I mentioned above) he has never met a person with double vision. I'm afraid it might get worse. could u pls suggest to me what to do. I would really really appreciate your help.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-19T07:56:08.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-19T07:56:08.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/i61pF2OY5lHfFCyhO9pki3pHycg\"", "id": "UgxkwxU5qFGzZ_sW0xt4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/Fs1i65gvD2R558jFvF6CZ1L7I_w\"", "id": "UgxkwxU5qFGzZ_sW0xt4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "treyyyTell\u2019dem", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78KRAJKiCMwyZIbaUPJl58S1wx2gN6NvDQbog=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcuj6u-V6wOYyzJDOzq6GqQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCcuj6u-V6wOYyzJDOzq6GqQ"}, "videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "textDisplay": "Lady Gaga didn\u2019t say anything offensive or as if she wanted people to follow her steps.
