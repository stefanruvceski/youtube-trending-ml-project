I have mental illness that i&#39;ve been struggling for 16 years (im 28). I went to see a Councillor in the beginning and it just made me feel judged. My mental illness stems from isolation and exclusion. I know the cure to my depression is simply the lack of a girlfriend and the inability to express love and receive love. The world beat the kindness out of me and mistook it for weakness. I got walked all over on . Coming from a broken family with no idea how to raise me and expected the school system to take care of me and set me up for life when in fact thats not what they do. I was a latch key kid and I kept all my thoughts to myself. My parents only got mad at my grades not realizing the reason for my less than stellar performance was because I was not receiving the adequate attention and affection I needed to excel. We live in this superficial world and fear of rejection is the primary battle I deal with. My potential was squandered and I am set back by a decade. I also got to experience a really dark decade and period in my life. Yippee. But this darkness has led me to become a stronger person with discipline and has opened up new knowledge, opportunities and appreciation for things that I would never have understood had I not gone through this catastrophic failure in my life. Unless you were given a good parent I do believe scarcity and hardship is the only way to understand the discipline necessary to understand business and money management. Necessity of money is needed to pursue wealth. I was given everything I wanted but not what I needed. ie. I was spoiled and my parents are rich. I hated waking up early for work.

I have mental illness that i've been struggling for 16 years (im 28). I went to see a Councillor in the beginning and it just made me feel judged. My mental illness stems from isolation and exclusion. I know the cure to my depression is simply the lack of a girlfriend and the inability to express love and receive love. The world beat the kindness out of me and mistook it for weakness. I got walked all over on . Coming from a broken family with no idea how to raise me and expected the school system to take care of me and set me up for life when in fact thats not what they do. I was a latch key kid and I kept all my thoughts to myself. My parents only got mad at my grades not realizing the reason for my less than stellar performance was because I was not receiving the adequate attention and affection I needed to excel. We live in this superficial world and fear of rejection is the primary battle I deal with. My potential was squandered and I am set back by a decade. I also got to experience a really dark decade and period in my life. Yippee. But this darkness has led me to become a stronger person with discipline and has opened up new knowledge, opportunities and appreciation for things that I would never have understood had I not gone through this catastrophic failure in my life.

I wouldnt put that kind of responsability onto her general care doctor ever again. \n\n\nhere's a simple analogy: lets say mental illness are like the \"cold/flu\" family (cold, flu , pneumonia, tonsil infection, bronchitis,etc)\nthey all have similar symptoms but some are deadly and other arent even that big of a concern but still shouldnt be ignored or it will get worse\n\n\nwell mental heatlh is quite similar. In this situation the cold would be depression and that pneumonia and bronchitis could be comparable to schyzophrenia and bipolar (btw this are all exemple for an analogy keep that in mind)\n\n\nits like when you have a pneumonia(or wtv that should be hospital matter and is not a cold) and your parent still think your faking to be sick \n\n\nDoctor are basically being the ignorant parent that think you arent as sick as you are because they cant pinpoint the symptoms.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-22T17:14:57.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-22T17:14:57.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/Z2p-3NlYYCu-JWSxOg1GaAjlTWQ\"", "id": "UgxZTP94wFBEKLNC2wp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/OYJBePKmMoK-lhV77NTaCS4yrHk\"", "id": "UgxZTP94wFBEKLNC2wp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "nicnaserio", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_EmSfmuqv-cOrp_dz8BnVEkAzixeRQ6M943g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLjY-9zzvmY0nhBR1pGioQQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLjY-9zzvmY0nhBR1pGioQQ"}, "videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "textDisplay": "It is So sad that people in US can&#39;t really take care of themselfs.
