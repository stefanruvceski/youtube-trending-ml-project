I wanna let it out.<br /><br />I&#39;m a 13 yr old girl. I studied in a single school since 1st grade up to 5th grade. My life was as normal as ever, having fun normally, having problems like a normal person would have. Until I transferred to another school for 6th grade. I felt so lonely, feeling too much pressure everyday. I lost everything, my friends, my 1st honor title, popularity, i just felt so lonely. It was mostly academically.I know it doesnt sound as painful as it actually is, because words cant ever describe what was happening in my mind as it was slowly being destroyed. I couldn&#39;t study properly, and there were lots of times that i couldnt go to school. I started getting angry easily, and I felt that it was a different kind of anger. It was anger, but at the same time, it was suffering. Whenever i get angry or have a panic attack, i would scratch my arms until it bleeds a bit. I also scratch my legs, thighs, and face. I couldnt describe how painful it was everyday, and most times it felt like I was stuck inside a small, dark box, separated from the world. I still experience that sometimes. Everyday, my mom would forcefully and painfully drag me for me to go to school. Whenever i didnt go to school, she would leave me outside our room for hours. (We live in a condo, so she would leave me in the hallways/rooftop)<br />It was this time when I started to feel something. My psychopathic self. I figured that she existed as protection. Everyday was full of suffering and pain, and she appeared as some sort of offense-defense. She came out whenever i was angry/suffering, and calms me down saying things like &quot;Shh, it&#39;s gonna be ok. I&#39;m here, so let me handle this&quot; in an aggressive but reassuring way. I would go to school angry, and while at school I would be pissed at everyone and scratch my arms as usual. I started going school continuously, but still angry. I experienced this &quot;psychopathic&quot; feeling for weeks, but it wasnt my other self. There were lots of times and attempts when I just wanted to bring a knife to school and stab everyone. I thought &quot;So what? I&#39;ll leave it to the future. It&#39;s up to my future self whatever happens.&quot;<br />I never got the chance to bring one though, because my mom was always around. Then, an imaginary shadow friend started to appear. He was pure black, with two white dots as his eyes. His form isn&#39;t of a human being, he looks a bit more cartoonish. The first time i felt him was at night when I was trying to sleep, in the dark. I felt scared at first, but when I turned on the light, he suddenly felt like a friend who would accompany me. He didnt do or say anything, he just stood still, always facing towards me. Whenever I walk around/go to a new room while closing the door, he would teleport near me. This only lasted a few weeks though, he doesnt exist anymore.<br /><br />Then something happened after graduation. I was chatting with someone who likes me, and I was starting to like him too as we chat 24/7. I don&#39;t know what happened, but I figured that I would tell him EVERYTHING that ive been going through. After all that typing and pouring all my problems onto that one message, he only immediately replied with &quot;ok.&quot; <br />that INSTANTLY angered me and made me feel betrayed. He thought it would be funny to just reply with that after one long message. My psychopathic self immediately came out to defend me. I/she started attacking and scaring him through messages. She was triggered, and I still remember how good it felt knowing that the prey that you&#39;re targetting is getting scared. She.. no I was using only one emoji and it was this &quot;\ud83d\ude42&quot;, to add an extra creepy effect to scare him more. <br />It felt so good.<br />Oh wait im back- she suddenly came out when i was talking about how good it felt. After she defended me, days after that, I regretted letting her out. He doesn&#39;t like me anymore because ofcourse, who would fall in love with someone scary and dangerous? and I just apologized and told him to forget about it. (we&#39;re on fine terms now, and we&#39;re still friends so it&#39;s ok)<br /><br />Moving on to 7th grade, which I am now, things started to hurt a LOT more. Things were organized, I started to know what was wrong with my mind, but at the same time it still felt painful. I dont know why, but back in 1st-2nd grade, i kept on being absent for class. (the only reason i could come up with myself was that it was so painfully mentally suffering)<br />Everyday my mom drags me forcefully around, and leaves me outside for hours, my body full of self-inflicted scratches. I started becoming suicidal. I thought i was already being suicidal before, but this time it was different. I researched the easiest suicidal methods that one could do at home, and started attempting some. I felt happy everytime someone was successful at committing suicide, and felt envious because they did it and I couldnt. That time, my mom doesnt let me outside for hours anymore, but instead lets me sleep on the couch, but beats me up first. Before she beats me up, I would go to the bathroom to call my psychopathic self for help and get ready. She handles pain wayyy better than I do, and she&#39;s a lot braver. I always experience these co-consciously, so it was still hard for me. She would laugh at the pain, wanting to get revenge, but at the same time tears would fall down my face. I was going insane. Laughing while crying, silently screaming. One morning, she went out of control. She started thinking about doing horrible things to others. We would always do things co-consciously, so that one morning, she had enough. She wanted to take over my whole body, my whole consciousness. But she couldnt. I, the one typing this, still existed and she wanted to destroy me because I was the one holding her back.  I fell asleep after that, and had this dream.<br />In my dream, i felt that someone was trying to kill me. It was the first time i felt what someone would feel when they know that they&#39;re about to get killed. The feeling of intense fear. Thats what I felt, the feeling of being targetted by a murderer. The appearance of the murderer was my brother, then i suddenly thought that this isnt my brother, its someone else. Then I felt that, its HER. My other self, despite having the appearance of my brother. I dont know the reason for that because my brother isnt related to any of these. Anyway, moving on to present time. I go to school everyday now and i have friends and improving my grades. It&#39;s been a long time since I felt like i was in another world, knowing things that i know no one else does. I also kinda missed having her around. (I can still feel her a bit though, even now while im typing)<br />Back then, i kept asking myself &quot;why me? why not other people? 7 billion people, and I get to experience this? what did an innocent little girl ever do?&quot;<br />But now, i kinda miss experiencing some. Not all of them, just the times when i discovered, knew, and felt things that no one in this world would underdstand. Kind of an amazing feeling.<br />She hasnt been coming out lately. But recently, just yesterday when we went out for groceries, i saw that the parking lot was filled with cars and the grocery was filled with people. They&#39;re buying all the stuff they can because of the coronavirus. Suddenly, I/she thought that something exciting is finally happening. She came out co-consciously with me. She was happy. &quot;I wish the virus would get me&quot; &quot;Finally something interesting is happening&quot; &quot;what a boring world&quot;<br />Is what she thought. I dont know if we&#39;re co-consciously being happy about it or if its only her. I think its only her, because talking about this now doesnt let me feel anything. <br /><br />Anywayy, typing all these doesnt feel like i let out anything at all. Everything was incomplete but i dont know how to put them into a more detailed way. Ofcourse i cant fit everything in a single comment nor can i express everything into words. Whatever, my mind feels lost right now trying to recover everything that has happened to me. I think i wanna come out more openly about myself, and face it positively. Im not scared anymore, and I accept my other self even though its a bit scary. I just need to talk to this openly to another person, and hopefully they&#39;ll understand me and help me. I hope i meet that person soon, the one who will accept me for who I am.", "textOriginal": "Can I just share my own personal story? I wanna let it out.\n\nI'm a 13 yr old girl.

I go to school everyday now and i have friends and improving my grades. It's been a long time since I felt like i was in another world, knowing things that i know no one else does. I also kinda missed having her around. (I can still feel her a bit though, even now while im typing)\nBack then, i kept asking myself \"why me? why not other people? 7 billion people, and I get to experience this? what did an innocent little girl ever do?\"\nBut now, i kinda miss experiencing some. Not all of them, just the times when i discovered, knew, and felt things that no one in this world would underdstand. Kind of an amazing feeling.\nShe hasnt been coming out lately. But recently, just yesterday when we went out for groceries, i saw that the parking lot was filled with cars and the grocery was filled with people. They're buying all the stuff they can because of the coronavirus. Suddenly, I/she thought that something exciting is finally happening. She came out co-consciously with me. She was happy. \"I wish the virus would get me\" \"Finally something interesting is happening\" \"what a boring world\"\nIs what she thought. I dont know if we're co-consciously being happy about it or if its only her. I think its only her, because talking about this now doesnt let me feel anything. \n\nAnywayy, typing all these doesnt feel like i let out anything at all. Everything was incomplete but i dont know how to put them into a more detailed way. Ofcourse i cant fit everything in a single comment nor can i express everything into words. Whatever, my mind feels lost right now trying to recover everything that has happened to me. I think i wanna come out more openly about myself, and face it positively. Im not scared anymore, and I accept my other self even though its a bit scary. I just need to talk to this openly to another person, and hopefully they'll understand me and help me. I hope i meet that person soon, the one who will accept me for who I am.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-10T13:21:26.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-10T13:21:26.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 1, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/k5sqObti3AOHw6KB4SmcymDomXA\"", "id": "Ugwe8ohtHB1-qfk1fzJ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "ek7JK6pattE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/GxiKJAzSyNjDvOW8RmhD1Ck2wkQ\"", "id": "Ugwe8ohtHB1-qfk1fzJ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Andrew Olsen", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyJJ4LpAqU7nnrkExOGfxRJanFddh3qaESkFA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjg84jzcqitREhlK1K_AP6Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjg84jzcqitREhlK1K_AP6Q"}, "videoId": "ek7JK6pattE", "textDisplay": "I have been BINGING this series!
