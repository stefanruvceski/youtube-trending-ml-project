Today I am doing a 24 hour challenge AGAIN. BUT, this time, I wanted to make it a little more interesting. I am not too big on challenges on my channel, just because I can't compete with the extreme challenges that so many other youtubers are willing to do LOL. I just like painting on things üòÇ PLUS, I feel like a lot of challenges these days have gotten really pointless. But, this one is good haha. I decided to try  to paint and decorate different things for 24 hours. I have a lot of art supplies laying around my art room, just begging to be painted. But I don't often have the time to paint that much at a time. So this was a great opportunity to put a bunch of it to good use finally.I am going to be painting on a seashell, painting a pencil pouch, painting a rock, painting a squishy (mini squishy makeover lol), making a custom mug, decorating a giant clothes pin and a surprise weird item LOL. This video almost turned out like a tiktok painting compilation haha.

I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Just about everyone knows of the Mazda Miata and the RX-7, but what about the tiny car Mazda made that has a huge following in the car community? Japan has variable taxes on vehicles based on their displacement, hence why manufacturers started making tiny cars called Kei cars.

The Autozam has super car features like the super rad gull-wing doors and even more interesting is the story of how the autozam came to be.

This test, which does not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, is intended to demonstrate Crew Dragon‚Äôs ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. The six-hour test window opens at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC. A backup opportunity with the same six-hour launch window opening at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC, is available on Monday, January 20. Current weather data suggests our best opportunity for the launch escape test will be towards the end of the four-hour window, but we will continue to provide updates as new data becomes available."

Limited tix available now: http://mad.mn/gunsakimbomonsterNerdy video game developer (Daniel Radcliffe) is a little too fond of stirring things up on the internet with his caustic, prodding, and antagonizing comments. One night, he makes the mistake of drunkenly dropping an inflammatory barb on a broadcast of Skizm, an illegal death-match fight club streamed live to the public. In response, Riktor (Ned Dennehy), the maniacal mastermind behind the channel, decides to force Miles' hand (or hands, as it were) and have him join the fun. Miles wakes to find heavy pistols bolted into his bones, and learns Nix (Samara Weaving), the trigger-happy star of Skizm, is his first opponent. Gleefully echoing elements of Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the Purge franchise, and videogames like Mortal Kombat, Guns Akimbo is hilariously dark, viciously violent, and potentially ‚Äî chillingly ‚Äî prescient. Director Jason Lei Howden (Deathgasm) foretells of a future that may soon await us: drone-captured live feeds, UFC-like competitions pushed to an extreme, and online streaming platforms used for gladiatorial entertainment all around the world. As Miles navigates the underworld of Skizm, the stakes ‚Äî and the ratings ‚Äî have never been higher. #GunsAkimbo #DanielRadcliffe #SamaraWeavingIn Cinemas March 5th 2020Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/madmanfilmsTwitter: http://twitter.com/madmanfilms Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/madmanfilms"

The planet, called TOI 1338b, is around 6.9 times larger than Earth, or between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn. It lies in a system 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Pictor.The stars in the system make an eclipsing binary, which occurs when the stellar companions circle each other in our plane of view. One is about 10% more massive than our Sun, while the other is cooler, dimmer and only one-third the Sun‚Äôs mass. TOI 1338b‚Äôs transits are irregular, between every 93 and 95 days, and vary in depth and duration thanks to the orbital motion of its stars. TESS only sees the transits crossing the larger star ‚Äî the transits of the smaller star are too faint to detect. Although the planet transits irregularly, its orbit is stable for at least the next 10 million years. The orbit‚Äôs angle to us, however, changes enough that the planet transit will cease after November 2023 and resume eight years later.Read more: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-mission-uncovers-its-1st-world-with-two-stars¬†Music: Albatross from Universal Production Music.Video credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight CenterChris Smith (USRA): Lead ProducerChris Smith (USRA): Lead AnimatorJeanette Kazmierczak (University of Maryland College Park): Lead Science WriterChris Smith (USRA): WriterVeselin Kostov (NASA Postdoctoral Fellow): ScientistThis video is public domain and along with other supporting visualizations can be downloaded from NASA Goddard's Scientific Visualization Studio at: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13510If you liked this video, subscribe to the NASA Goddard YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/NASAGoddardFollow NASA‚Äôs Goddard Space Flight Center¬∑ Instagram http://www.instagram.com/nasagoddard¬∑ Twitter http://twitter.com/NASAGoddard¬∑ Twitter http://twitter.com/NASAGoddardPix¬∑ Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/NASAGoddard¬∑ Flickr http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc"
