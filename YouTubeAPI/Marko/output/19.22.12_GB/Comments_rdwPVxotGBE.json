Now on to what I wanna say. I saw the OT when I  was , 6 , 9, and 12. I&#39;m never gonna be those ages again. I now see things through a 48 year old adult who went to college graduated got married have a job and kids. I&#39;m not gonna see things the same way. I work in the world of hospice so my life is grounded in reality. My parents both passed 6 years ago the ones who took me to those movies. I feel like we have all forgotten what it&#39;s like to just let go and go to a movie and see if it connects with that inner child versus looking at things through adult eyes of what we want or what we would do. For me it makes since the Emperor is still there. He is the true villain.  Vader was redeemed.  His grandson is redeemed.  The skywalker name is one of honor and hero. I know for me when I watch a movie and it connects then I have enjoyed it. I didn&#39;t sit around worrying about what it did or didn&#39;t give me. Or what I would have done different. I did that also when I was a kid with my toys and my own adventures. I dont feel it cheapens what happened in the original trilogy i feel like it honors it and brings reverence to it. Lando with his speech to Poe we did it together. With Poe  speech for our parents.  I can counter an argument for every single thing someone has fault with this movie and end of trilogy with one to OT. because NONE OF THEM ARE PERFECT. LOTS OF THINGS DONT MAKE SINCE. FROM YOUR FATHER WAS BETRAYED BY A JEDI TO I AM YOUR FATHER. TO LUKE AND THE PRINCESS BEING BROTHER AND SISTER.  But I dont because I remember what made me fall in love with these cheesy little movies. I think we have forgotten that now we say why didnt they just leave it alone. Yet we all wanted them to continue the story. We forget that by the time they decided to start 7,8,9 our characters have aged and cant be central leads anymore. Let me say a few other things that I further proves my generation the Gen xers really have become cynical.  I still really know nothing about boba fett. Not with out researching or reading things outside of movies. I mean I know he is a clone, I know he is a bounty hunter. And I know when I was a kid he was Cool. I know nothing about those whole bounty hunters on the deck in empire IG 88, Bosk , Dengar . What do we really know about Jabba from the movies other than he is a vile gangster. What do we know about the sajd people. Hell what do we really know about Yoda. So I dont need more about Knights of Ren. The movie isnt the Knights of Ren  anymore than empire or return were the story of Boba Fett or Jaba. I didnt need to know all that to take away from my movie experience. I enjoyed the movie I made a connection with it. For me It made the whole 9 movies connect to me and my inner child. I dont want to go to movies and worry about what it didnt give me i want to go to movies and enjoy what they do give me. And hopefully I enjoy it. If i dont i wont watch it again.  I know this there was a time in my late 20&#39;s and early thirties my dear mother asked me do you not like star wars anymore. Because i didnt care to watch them like i did. I told her I did at the time I just have watched it so much. I thought about that after watching this movie today for the third time this weekend. I didnt like them because at that age I was cynical and thought they were childish and cheesy. But now I look at it and realize I do love star wars all of it that entire galaxy far far away that happened long ago. And I cant get enough of it.  Are some movies better than others of course. Are some not as bad as people think yes. I enjoyed Solo did I need it probably not am I glad I watched yes. Do I like rogue one yes did I need it no but I love it. Do I need the Mandalorian no am I glad I have it absolutely.  Did I need episodes 7-9 no but I&#39;m glad I got it and I&#39;m glad I saw it. Last thing I personally love Rey taking Skywalker name again it&#39;s a sign of reverence and honor to Anakin to Luke to Leigha to Ben. I think people forget with this whole it cheapens vader sacrifice.  It doesnt the sacrifice isnt about if the emperor survived or not. Its about saving his son and redemption for him being the man he should have been before the fall. Have a nice day. And when I was a kid I wanted to be a Skywalker so for old times sake.
