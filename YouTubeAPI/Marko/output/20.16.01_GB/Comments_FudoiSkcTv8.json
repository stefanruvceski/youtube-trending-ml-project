They are not even aware that they should develop a relationship with their PCP  so that these kinds of things can get taken care of in a triage fashion like you mention. I talk about this through the lens of the Hispanic population, they don&#39;t know how the medical system works in reality <del>same reason a lot of them tend to go to the ER for something that can be seen at urgent care. The problem lies when it comes to government sponsored insurances. The doctors who take these insurances tend to work at free or low cost clinics that end up being overpacked with all kinds of patients. I went in to one after ending up at the ER for dyspnea and anxiety for a follow up and the doctor really only spent about 5 minutes on the problem and immediately wanted to prescribe me anxiolytics without asking anything else other than what a quick questionnaire -risk factor questionnaire</del> scored me at. However she was more interested in how the rest of my body was functioning <del>which yes it is important</del> but wasn&#39;t the priority at the time. While I agree that specialities get into their respective fields because of their interest specialty doctors can not ignore the more &quot;basic&quot; cases. You can&#39;t help everyone but you can help someone no matter how big or small. I think what Lady Gaga was talking about was the fact that many people get their antidepressants or anxiolytics and that&#39;s it nothing else. No referral to a therapist. No referral to a psychiatrist. Or a very quick followup the next visit to &quot;see how they are doing,&quot; and that&#39;s it. That where the problem lies. You and I both know the importance of dual treatment for mental health and that things like anxiety and depression are best treated with a combination of drugs and some form of therapy. That&#39;s what she is alluding to, the fact that all most people are given a lot of times is the drugs and not the therapy which is a very crucial component of treatment. Doctors are seen as a form of authority, so to many people what the doctor says or doesn&#39;t say, goes. Many times doctors are more concerned about, let&#39;s say a pt&#39;s cholesterol levels despite having no indication of high cholesterol, than their chief complaint of depression or anxiety so they just check the box that says tx given for anxiety and move on to the next pt. That&#39;s what she&#39;s alluding to, and it&#39;s more common than you think. It&#39;s happened to me, fortunately I know better and I know how the system works because I want to practice medicine at some point in my life, but to others who really don&#39;t know better, this happens quite often.", "textOriginal": "Hi Dr Mike, I hear what you say. When presented in the way that you did it makes sense. But what Lady Gaga said also has truth to it. Many people do not have PCP. They are not even aware that they should develop a relationship with their PCP  so that these kinds of things can get taken care of in a triage fashion like you mention. I talk about this through the lens of the Hispanic population, they don't know how the medical system works in reality -same reason a lot of them tend to go to the ER for something that can be seen at urgent care. The problem lies when it comes to government sponsored insurances. The doctors who take these insurances tend to work at free or low cost clinics that end up being overpacked with all kinds of patients. I went in to one after ending up at the ER for dyspnea and anxiety for a follow up and the doctor really only spent about 5 minutes on the problem and immediately wanted to prescribe me anxiolytics without asking anything else other than what a quick questionnaire -risk factor questionnaire- scored me at. However she was more interested in how the rest of my body was functioning -which yes it is important- but wasn't the priority at the time. While I agree that specialities get into their respective fields because of their interest specialty doctors can not ignore the more \"basic\" cases. You can't help everyone but you can help someone no matter how big or small. I think what Lady Gaga was talking about was the fact that many people get their antidepressants or anxiolytics and that's it nothing else. No referral to a therapist. No referral to a psychiatrist. Or a very quick followup the next visit to \"see how they are doing,\" and that's it. That where the problem lies. You and I both know the importance of dual treatment for mental health and that things like anxiety and depression are best treated with a combination of drugs and some form of therapy. That's what she is alluding to, the fact that all most people are given a lot of times is the drugs and not the therapy which is a very crucial component of treatment. Doctors are seen as a form of authority, so to many people what the doctor says or doesn't say, goes. Many times doctors are more concerned about, let's say a pt's cholesterol levels despite having no indication of high cholesterol, than their chief complaint of depression or anxiety so they just check the box that says tx given for anxiety and move on to the next pt. That's what she's alluding to, and it's more common than you think. It's happened to me, fortunately I know better and I know how the system works because I want to practice medicine at some point in my life, but to others who really don't know better, this happens quite often.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 7, "publishedAt": "2020-01-16T18:06:45.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-16T18:06:45.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/f4eAky1rN4pa4LYxMycoHjR6BnI\"", "id": "Ugx8QLsltvOWI7qRwU94AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/LlYlRaRzqjMpXEYR7Ze-Wt4uXX0\"", "id": "Ugx8QLsltvOWI7qRwU94AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Jasmine Collins", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-VvDOvbxWjwHTslWcV_lon-qBz-03lxgksDw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3fnBIOtCoh-wJdZtlm_Kfg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3fnBIOtCoh-wJdZtlm_Kfg"}, "videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "textDisplay": "Someone with a mental health condition may not be able to handle finding a psychiatrist or therapist, either.
