First I would just like to say I love your videos and the knowledge you spread. Thank you so much for using this as a platform. I am in the medical field as well (med/surg nurse). I found this video very interesting and you expressed an opinion opposite of what I would think and was wondering if I could email you? It&#39;s in regards to using a FP to prescribe antidepressants as a first line vs going to see a specialist.  I always thought it would be better to see a specialist for therapy sessions vs starting medicine right away. I believe professionals in healthcare could learn a great deal from each other and would love to hear an FPs reasoning and point of view as well as ask some follow up questions.  It would also help to educate me as family and friends often come to me for advice and I would hate to lead someone astray from such an important topic. I will also read the articles you posted.

People reacted with disbelief, astonishment, and anger (especially family members, who accused me of &quot;faking&quot;).

I don&#39;t know how all those other doctors could have missed it.&quot; In spite of this, he turned out to be an arrogant a**hole. 15 years later, my family doctor realized I had to commute for nearly 4 hours to see him and said, &quot;You don&#39;t have to see him again.&quot; I said, &quot;Wait, what?&quot; My former family doctor flatly refused to prescribe for me, said it wasn&#39;t her area, and no other shrinks were available, so I assumed I was &quot;stuck&quot;. My new family doctor said she would prescribe for me, but I had to see another psychiatrist. I held my nose and went in. I just told her I had bipolar, as I did not want to go through another meat grinder of misdiagnosis and wildly conflicting opinion. She turned out to be respectful and attentive, the polar opposite of the last one, but now, ironically, I am well enough not to need to see her regularly. She is there in case I go through a rough patch. This is, of course, only about 5% or 10% of my story.

I dragged myself out of it, sober, and found a psychologist whom I worked with for years. She said she did not believe in psychiatric diagnoses and just treated patients individually. I was more or less OK (on an antidepressant prescribed BY A FAMILY DOCTOR) for FIFTEEN years, then landed back in the hospital. People reacted with disbelief, astonishment, and anger (especially family members, who accused me of \"faking\"). My file  from 15 years earlier said \"borderline personality disorder\" and \"alcoholic\", and I was treated accordingly in the hospital, as if I had not made any progress at all in 15 years,  They assumed I was still drinking and had a mental illness which they told me was \"untreatable\". I nearly did not survive the \"cure\", but dragged myself out of it, finally found a psychiatrist who interviewed me, stopped the interview halfway through, and said, \"I'd stake my reputation on the fact that you have bipolar disorder. You are a textbook case. I don't know how all those other doctors could have missed it.\" In spite of this, he turned out to be an arrogant a**hole. 15 years later, my family doctor realized I had to commute for nearly 4 hours to see him and said, \"You don't have to see him again.\" I said, \"Wait, what?\" My former family doctor flatly refused to prescribe for me, said it wasn't her area, and no other shrinks were available, so I assumed I was \"stuck\". My new family doctor said she would prescribe for me, but I had to see another psychiatrist. I held my nose and went in. I just told her I had bipolar, as I did not want to go through another meat grinder of misdiagnosis and wildly conflicting opinion. She turned out to be respectful and attentive, the polar opposite of the last one, but now, ironically, I am well enough not to need to see her regularly. She is there in case I go through a rough patch. This is, of course, only about 5% or 10% of my story. What a hell of a battlefield, and this was from doctors and \"therapists\" who were supposed to be helping me.  When I tried to protest any of this mistreatment,  I was told it was MY fault for \"being too complicated\".", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-20T20:57:26.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-20T21:07:25.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/0RU1QbZpSx3EMZIOqMYWxGw3ODg\"", "id": "Ugy6WFSrj2VYi0q_-6Z4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/Hx4tum_-Bm1US2GEQoQ9DQ1EvPE\"", "id": "Ugy6WFSrj2VYi0q_-6Z4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Heather LaVigne", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l798p2jCq_oYQBLJw5DJ6BHKrPKlx-cKWx2y1g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBujkS6e-4Ie1Dsj9-ur7vw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBujkS6e-4Ie1Dsj9-ur7vw"}, "videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "textDisplay": "That statement bothered me too.
