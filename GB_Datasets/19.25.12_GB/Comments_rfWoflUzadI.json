But the Disney trilogy has disappointed me.<br />The prequels told a story of how a young boy turns to the dark side of the force. You see Anakin\u2019s journey and feel connected to his journey and the other characters around him like his friendship with Obi-wan and chancellor Palpatine. The original trilogy tells a story of how a farm boy wants more in life and has big aspirations and dreams that eventually get fulfilled. The story of Luke saving his father. His father had been a slave his whole life from being on the Jedi Order to being a slave to the emperor. Vader finally felt free when he saved his son because that\u2019s finally when he got the power to save the ones he loved. The entire saga is about Anakin and fulling the \u201cchosen one\u201d prophecy of bringing balance to the force. You felt and knew the characters and the story that it told. Not with the Disney sequel trilogy.<br />The Disney sequel trilogy is a mess. It\u2019s unoriginal. Episode 8 is at least somewhat original as described later. But, the trilogy didn\u2019t know what story to tell or what they wanted for its characters. Episode 7 asks all these questions: how did maz get Luke\u2019s lightsaber? Who is Rey? Why did Kylo turn to the dark side? Why does the first order exist? Episode 8 decides to answer these question by saying Kylo is a student to Luke who\u2019s raw power scared Luke because it reminded him of his father. Rey is just a normal person who happens to be strong in the force. Whatever the first order actually is is being led by kylo and that snoke wasn\u2019t an eveil dark sith after all. The republic is plagued with leadership problems and people like Poe and Finn think they can go off and save the day. It\u2019s set up to say in the next movie how does Rey who has this new knowledge of what it means to be a true jedi defeat Kylo who is now a Sith Lord as he killed his own master to become it. Then episode 9 completely throws all this away. The first order is just Palpatines empire. Kylo wasn\u2019t someone who became a Sith Lord himself, he was just a pawn of Palpatine. Rey wasn\u2019t this independent force user who could learn this on her own, she was always a Skywalker destined to do all this as Anakin is palpatines son and Rey is palpatines granddaughter. It rehashes similar plot points but these movies didn\u2019t know what they wanted to be. These movies couldn\u2019t be their own movies and couldn\u2019t follow one story. I at least respect episode 8 for trying to be different and stray away from the Skywalker saga we\u2019ve already seen. <br /><br />TLDR; my opinion is the Disney sequel trilogy sucks and will never surpass the original episodes 1-6.", "textOriginal": "I grew up on Star Wars.

Not with the Disney sequel trilogy.\nThe Disney sequel trilogy is a mess. It\u2019s unoriginal. Episode 8 is at least somewhat original as described later. But, the trilogy didn\u2019t know what story to tell or what they wanted for its characters. Episode 7 asks all these questions: how did maz get Luke\u2019s lightsaber? Who is Rey? Why did Kylo turn to the dark side? Why does the first order exist? Episode 8 decides to answer these question by saying Kylo is a student to Luke who\u2019s raw power scared Luke because it reminded him of his father. Rey is just a normal person who happens to be strong in the force. Whatever the first order actually is is being led by kylo and that snoke wasn\u2019t an eveil dark sith after all. The republic is plagued with leadership problems and people like Poe and Finn think they can go off and save the day. It\u2019s set up to say in the next movie how does Rey who has this new knowledge of what it means to be a true jedi defeat Kylo who is now a Sith Lord as he killed his own master to become it. Then episode 9 completely throws all this away. The first order is just Palpatines empire. Kylo wasn\u2019t someone who became a Sith Lord himself, he was just a pawn of Palpatine. Rey wasn\u2019t this independent force user who could learn this on her own, she was always a Skywalker destined to do all this as Anakin is palpatines son and Rey is palpatines granddaughter. It rehashes similar plot points but these movies didn\u2019t know what they wanted to be. These movies couldn\u2019t be their own movies and couldn\u2019t follow one story. I at least respect episode 8 for trying to be different and stray away from the Skywalker saga we\u2019ve already seen. \n\nTLDR; my opinion is the Disney sequel trilogy sucks and will never surpass the original episodes 1-6.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-25T03:52:35.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-25T03:52:35.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/yEA5pz-dae4ITnI_fneS6SNOTD8\"", "id": "UgzollJeu269zQEue6B4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rfWoflUzadI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/Cyny79_iCHWeiQ6iJEi5TESgYEo\"", "id": "UgzollJeu269zQEue6B4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "nordic Boy", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_iEJysFxQ_ZQ5RQSzNdT0TNLTq4NisLwkovQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcz1rFICbJcK4fZjYoExp7g", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCcz1rFICbJcK4fZjYoExp7g"}, "videoId": "rfWoflUzadI", "textDisplay": "Loved the movie 10/10", "textOriginal": "Loved the movie 10/10", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-25T03:45:42.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-25T03:45:42.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/TpGZjgfAd3acDLLZweYH4IwVHHQ\"", "id": "Ugxmb2zRlpMBYkou70p4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rfWoflUzadI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/n93wD2z_ebd9lOVKH2EGqUGOrdA\"", "id": "Ugxmb2zRlpMBYkou70p4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Adam Paul", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-Im8q88RiPMbmMtdbeP6UIrMOz5JZEMPl_1Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiWzfDwDuJFW3VFmfQr39zg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCiWzfDwDuJFW3VFmfQr39zg"}, "videoId": "rfWoflUzadI", "textDisplay": "Skywalker was born of the force and there was a part where Luke told Rey something along the lines of somethings are deeper than blood or something like that.

I didn\u2019t like the fact that chewy lived either because of the luck of there being a \u2018second\u2019 arrest ship.

Then Rey kills him but decides to save him and heal him and this moment kinda summarised a lot of my problems in the film. A character would die and the makers were almost too scared to kill a character off so decided to save them again.

So now palp is the most powerful being in the galaxy after taking the power away from the only two threats to him (which are living and he\u2019s also now back to life which in the previous films we see how good his saber skills are against yoda whos the most powerful Jedi of all the films). But somehow Rey gets up and is able to take 5 steps towards him and overpower him. In the episode 6 it took Luke and Vader to overpower him and they were arguable at their peak strengths ( definitely luke anyway ) but then Rey just kills him like that. And I didn\u2019t like the kissing scene either, it was so obvious and cringe oh my. That\u2019s like if Voldemort and hermione started kissing at the end of Harry Potter if Voldemort turned back to a good tom riddle, what a load of shit. I didn\u2019t like that. What I think would\u2019ve been a great final battle ( for the whole of the saga may I remind you against the most powerful and controlling being in the series) is if we saw the Jedi ghosts appear and bc palp is so strong he creates the sith ghosts and they fight while Rey and kylo fight palp.

The last Jedi just kinda killed a lot of things, Luke throwing his father\u2019s saber away, not a good thing. He should have kept it. Then the whole chase scene throughout the movie is recycled in way too many other movie plots and it\u2019s just bland, along with the salt Hoth at the end which was cool but recycled from an already great film which did not do it justice. It was literally the empire strikes back except being played backwards and ray didn\u2019t get injured or brought down in anyway to make her want to train to get better, the villain needs to win more often than the hero to make them menacing to the hero. And in which case the Kyle turning back to the light side plot can then be completed in the rise of skywalker if done better than killing his master then playing him like an idiot infront of his entire army. And still make him a morally grey character anyway and make ray be the one to start her decent to the dark side, it would make the next movie make more sense. Now the rise of skywalker. The one that could have brought it back, a lot of the things in the movie can stay, that\u2019s fine. My main issue is with the end and palpatine. The Star Wars saga is about the skywalker family, mainly anakin, he is the chosen one. So if you\u2019re going to bring back the emperor then bring back the chosen one. Mainly with Han Solo. During that fight, send anakin back with Han to talk to Kylo and after the long talk with Han then have anakin come back and tell him that he can avenge his wrongs by destroying the emperor. Both knowing that kylo is no where near strong enough to do that anakin tells him to the then come to endor to his grave. While all this is goin on ray does exactly what she does in the movie except palpatine steps in as the younger republic version of himself like he did with Ezra and convince her to come to him so she can take the remainder of the emperial resources and restore the republic. She agrees and goes. Kylo reaches Endor and goes to the grave, and then meditates on his grave raising anakin skywalker from the dead transcending his power and essence into Ben and then heads to exegol, with a nice little send off from obi wan, yoda. We then switch back to ray who has taken both the sabers to the exegol and drops anakins lightsaber and enters, she\u2019s in a destressed state and the pull to the dark side is really breaking her down. So she enters like normal. Ben shows up exegol and as he\u2019s about to enter he sees anakins saber and picks it up and Luke then talks to him, as Luke is now speaking to his father and his old apprentice it\u2019s very touching and he tells him what ray is about to do. He heads off and goes into the temple. Ray crying and afraid is then met by palpatine who is mind tricking the whole situation to be a warm coming home to his granddaughter and the new impress and restorer to the galaxy. They sit and talk for a while and ray grows more fond to the idea. Ben is now trying to get to her and all the knights of ren stop him.(they would have to be more powerful or just more of them. But either way palpatine tricks his mind and prevents him from knowing the true way to ray. Anakin shows him, while fighting the knights. Then the resistance shows up and they open fire on the empiral resources. The empire fires back, the fight does not give well for the resistance. Palpatine opens the hatch and shows ray what is happening, she tells him to stop and he explains that as long as he lives he controls the empire and they will keep fighting and that if she wants it to end she has to kill him, become the impress and bring order and save her friends, stating that by doing this she can restore the republic and save her friends, but instead of the palpatine meniachle laugh he shows her love and support. And she grows to believe it. It cuts back to Ben still fighting his way back. And the voices of all the evil he\u2019s done trying to take over but then anakin with his outrageous power helps block them out as he gets closer to the throne room. Ray ignites her lightsaber standing to kill her grandfather. He smiles and she remembers all the anger and the rage she had and she just wants it to be over, and as she kills palpatine, Ben comes in the throne room screaming no. She turns around startled, seeing Ben but more I touch with the light side then he\u2019s ever been. Then her saber starts to his and the color then becomes corrupted and turns red, a giant red and black cloud possesses her like anakins did to Ben. And now her eyes turn yellow and she looks down on Ben. Ben try\u2019s to turn her back but then she speaks and the words are hers but it\u2019s emperor speaking. She states that she is now more powerful than one has ever been, and Ben breaks down, then stares back at her revealing that anakin has now taken over Ben just as palpatine did to ray, and a titanic battle begins between the emperor of the the galaxy\u2019s and the strongest sith that has ever existed( calling himself the eternal reign of the sith) and anakin the chosen one, who will bring the force back into balance as it was said in the days of old. And obviously this battle would be very titanic, revealing godlike abilities that no one has ever seen before in books, video games, just ever.
