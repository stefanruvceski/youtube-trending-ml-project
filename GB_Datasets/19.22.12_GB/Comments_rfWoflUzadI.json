Who was palps banging? And he was out banging women after his death? His son was 25-30 in the film and Rey is a grown woman so we\u2019re talking a 50-55 year span between when we thought he was dead and ep. 9. The timeline doesn\u2019t match up. Han has a force ghost somehow. Why did leia die? Why did they just disappear? How did Rey use blue force lightning? Even tho she\u2019s a palpatine it\u2019s only a dark side power. Why didn\u2019t chewy die? There wasn\u2019t another ship there like they said.
