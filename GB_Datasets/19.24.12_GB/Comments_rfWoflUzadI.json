Luke Skywalker is a character we haven&#39;t seen for almost three full decades! Do you actually think just because he was a happy man with a positive outlook at the end of return of the Jedi that meant he was supposed to stay that way forever? People change as they grow. The person you are in your 20s is never the person you are in your 60&#39;s. And optimistic people lose that perspective as they get older and the world beats them down fairly frequently. And let&#39;s not forget that the optimistic and respectful person everyone says Luke was in the original trilogy is flat out untrue. He spent most of a new Hope whining to everyone and complaining about everything that was happening and spends just about all of the first act back talking and disrespecting his uncle. I mean it literally took two murders and a destruction of property to get him to go with Obi-Wan and even then he spends most of his time continuously arguing with Han Solo! Then in the Empire strikes back he&#39;s immediately disrespectful and dismissive of Yoda to the point that Obi-Wan had to come back as a ghost voice and flat out tell him &quot;This IS Yoda you idiot!&quot; And even then when he begins his training he still acts dismissive and disrespectful, ignoring his teacher and disobeying his instructions right up to the moment he straight up bails to go do something that Yoda and Obi-Wan repeatedly told him was not going to work and would only make things worse. Return of the Jedi however is hard to judge since he doesn&#39;t show up for the jabba sequence until the end of it then spends The middle 3rd of the movie hanging out in tree houses with teddy bears before going to the death star and wrapping up the rest of the movie by being rude and disrespectful to the Emperor (which I&#39;m sure we all think is OK since it was the emperor and it&#39;s OK to be rude to the villain in movies.). but if you ignore who he was talking to you realize Luke was just reverting back to his old arrogant bratty self because he was in a situation where doing so would be acceptable. <br /><br />So in summary let me put it to you this way: imagine you are Luke Skywalker. You are a person who spent your whole childhood as something of an arrogant brat who only thinks about themself while continuously disrespecting your aunt and uncle, The people who took you in after your parents deaths even though doing so was basically a crime. You are a person who can return to your house one day and find it on fire with the smoldering corpses of these people who gave you a home lying dead at the front door without shedding a single tear over it and then go on with the rest of your life without ever even mentioning them again. But then you slowly start to improve yourself as you make new friends and try to forge yourself into something better so that you can help others. You struggle and you suffer but you keep fighting through it until eventually you reach your goal! You beat the bad guy, you redeem your father, you end a war, and then finally get to achieve your dream of building a new Temple and restarting the Jedi order. But then after years of success and a seemingly clear path ahead of you suddenly your nephew, your twin sister&#39;s son, your own student, your own goddamn family turns on you and in one night burns your temple to the ground and massacres every single one of your other students; he quite literally murders your life&#39;s work right in front of you... how optimistic would YOU be then? How positive would you feel about life and your role in it as you walk through the burning rubble stepping over the corpses of the children you taught? Especially when you remember that a brief moment of internal conflict as you stood over your sleeping nephew is what kick started the whole thing. Would it even matter to you at that point if it was you or if it was Ben who did the wrong thing? Or would you find yourself feeling like none of it would have ever happened if you hadn&#39;t gotten involved? All your students are dead and your entire life&#39;s work is a cinder just because you got involved. Would you find yourself thinking none of it would have happened if you had stayed out of it. If you had done nothing then you wouldn&#39;t have scared your nephew into a murder spree. If you had done nothing you wouldn&#39;t have made things worse. If you had done nothing things would be better. Maybe doing nothing is the safest thing you can do now. Maybe nothing is the only thing you should do from now on. Would you be right or would you be wrong? Or more importantly would it even matter to you anymore? When you try to look back on your youth and remember the heroic do-gooder you were but all you can see are the burning bodies of dead children and dead dreams what would you rather do? Play the blame game before going off to fight and kill another member of your family, essentially repeating your life like a record that won&#39;t stop skipping, or would you realize a 60-year-old man has no chance of repeating The glory days of his 20s and the sudden lack of any remaining students means there&#39;s no one to take your place. Because if it was me I know what I would want to do at that point. I&#39;d just want to get the hell away from it all. I&#39;d think every time I get involved I either fail or make everything worse. Hell I even failed back during those glory days! When it all came down to the final moment and I face the emperor as a Jedi I ended up on the ground in a smoking heap of lightning while daddy killed the bad guy for me. Have I ever truly been the hero? Or have I been wrong my entire life? I think I just want to be alone now. Maybe for a while. Maybe for a looooong while. <br /><br />Seems a bit much? Well that shit happens to people every single day. And just because Star Wars is meant to be fantasy doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t portray characters in a realistic way. But a guy who stays chipper and heroic after half a century of fighting, failing, and repeated family betrayals? THAT&#39;s the real fantasy.", "textOriginal": "No offense intended here but I can't help but wonder what makes you or anyone else for that matter think they are qualified to say \"That's just not Luke.\" ? Luke Skywalker is a character we haven't seen for almost three full decades! Do you actually think just because he was a happy man with a positive outlook at the end of return of the Jedi that meant he was supposed to stay that way forever? People change as they grow. The person you are in your 20s is never the person you are in your 60's. And optimistic people lose that perspective as they get older and the world beats them down fairly frequently. And let's not forget that the optimistic and respectful person everyone says Luke was in the original trilogy is flat out untrue. He spent most of a new Hope whining to everyone and complaining about everything that was happening and spends just about all of the first act back talking and disrespecting his uncle. I mean it literally took two murders and a destruction of property to get him to go with Obi-Wan and even then he spends most of his time continuously arguing with Han Solo! Then in the Empire strikes back he's immediately disrespectful and dismissive of Yoda to the point that Obi-Wan had to come back as a ghost voice and flat out tell him \"This IS Yoda you idiot!\" And even then when he begins his training he still acts dismissive and disrespectful, ignoring his teacher and disobeying his instructions right up to the moment he straight up bails to go do something that Yoda and Obi-Wan repeatedly told him was not going to work and would only make things worse. Return of the Jedi however is hard to judge since he doesn't show up for the jabba sequence until the end of it then spends The middle 3rd of the movie hanging out in tree houses with teddy bears before going to the death star and wrapping up the rest of the movie by being rude and disrespectful to the Emperor (which I'm sure we all think is OK since it was the emperor and it's OK to be rude to the villain in movies.). but if you ignore who he was talking to you realize Luke was just reverting back to his old arrogant bratty self because he was in a situation where doing so would be acceptable. \n\nSo in summary let me put it to you this way: imagine you are Luke Skywalker. You are a person who spent your whole childhood as something of an arrogant brat who only thinks about themself while continuously disrespecting your aunt and uncle, The people who took you in after your parents deaths even though doing so was basically a crime. You are a person who can return to your house one day and find it on fire with the smoldering corpses of these people who gave you a home lying dead at the front door without shedding a single tear over it and then go on with the rest of your life without ever even mentioning them again. But then you slowly start to improve yourself as you make new friends and try to forge yourself into something better so that you can help others. You struggle and you suffer but you keep fighting through it until eventually you reach your goal! You beat the bad guy, you redeem your father, you end a war, and then finally get to achieve your dream of building a new Temple and restarting the Jedi order. But then after years of success and a seemingly clear path ahead of you suddenly your nephew, your twin sister's son, your own student, your own goddamn family turns on you and in one night burns your temple to the ground and massacres every single one of your other students; he quite literally murders your life's work right in front of you... how optimistic would YOU be then?
