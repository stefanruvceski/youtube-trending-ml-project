You combine geographical neighbour constituencies into one voting block, for example 5 seats. These 5 constituencies would still return 5 MPs, but the combined electorate votes PR. So for every 20% (100%/5 seats) of the vote your party wins, you get one of those 5 seats. Any remaining seat(s) with no party or candidate having 20% of more of the vote simply goes to whoever has the most votes left. <br /><br /><br /><br />This system allows for local representation, independents can still stand and have a realistic chance of election and nothing changes in how people need to vote - they still put one X in one box. No need for a complex multi-voting system. It results in a much fairer result and far, far less &quot;ignored&quot; votes.<br /><br />The number of combined constituencies could depend on the geographical size - for instance, very large constituencies like those in the Scottish Highlands could remain as they are, or maybe only combine 2 or 3 at most, to maintain the &quot;local&quot; representation and access to MP.<br /><br />Example of how this would work:<br /><br />The first 5 seats in SW England (as they are literally the edge of the country and easier to group with less complications):<br />St Ives - Tory<br />Camborne &amp; Redruth - Tory<br />Truro &amp; Falmouth - Tory<br />St Austell &amp; Newquay - Tory<br />Cornwall North - Tory<br /><br /><br />Total Votes cast across all 5 seats:<br />Tory  = 141,310 = 52.6%<br />Labour = 63,556 = 23.7%<br />Lib Dem = 53,515 = 19.9%<br />Green = 5,636 = 2.1%<br />Other  = 4,393 = 1.6%<br />Total Votes = 268,410<br /><br />So under this new system, for every 20% you get one seat, so all those above 20% get the first seats:<br />Tory 2 (40%) seats, leaving (52.6 - 40) 12.6% remaining<br />Labour 1 seat, leaving (23.7 - 20) 3.7% remaining<br /><br />So 3 of 5 seats already won. Now no party has 20% left, so next 2 seats go to the highest remaining totals, which are:<br />Lib Dem (19.9%)<br />and Tory (12.6%)<br /><br />So the 5 seats would be:<br />Tory 3 (60% of seats from 52.5% of vote)<br />Labour 1 (20% of seats from 23.7% of vote)<br />Lib Dem 1 (20% of seats from 19.9% of vote)<br /><br />Tories still get a majority, but now other parties get their deserved representation too. Instead of having (100 - 52.6) 47.4% &quot;ignored&quot; votes, under this system its only (3.7 + 2.1 + 1.6) 7.4% &quot;ignored&quot;. This really would incentivise more voters to actually vote, as each vote has a far higher chance of actually counting, even in a very one-party place such as this. Would people change who they voted for under this system? A percentage would for sure, no question. But would they have to change the process of how to vote? No. Yet everyone gets a much fairer result and with local representation. Surely a win win for everyone - apart from the minority who play the system to gain power.......<br /><br />(Note: these seats were chosen for simplicities sake, choose any 5 seats in any area to see the same effect, including Labour or SNP heartlands)", "textOriginal": "Localised PR solves most of these issues, as I've been saying for years now.\n\nBut what is it?\n\n\nIts very simple. You combine geographical neighbour constituencies into one voting block, for example 5 seats. These 5 constituencies would still return 5 MPs, but the combined electorate votes PR. So for every 20% (100%/5 seats) of the vote your party wins, you get one of those 5 seats. Any remaining seat(s) with no party or candidate having 20% of more of the vote simply goes to whoever has the most votes left. \n\n\n\nThis system allows for local representation, independents can still stand and have a realistic chance of election and nothing changes in how people need to vote - they still put one X in one box. No need for a complex multi-voting system. It results in a much fairer result and far, far less \"ignored\" votes.\n\nThe number of combined constituencies could depend on the geographical size - for instance, very large constituencies like those in the Scottish Highlands could remain as they are, or maybe only combine 2 or 3 at most, to maintain the \"local\" representation and access to MP.\n\nExample of how this would work:\n\nThe first 5 seats in SW England (as they are literally the edge of the country and easier to group with less complications):\nSt Ives - Tory\nCamborne & Redruth - Tory\nTruro & Falmouth - Tory\nSt Austell & Newquay - Tory\nCornwall North - Tory\n\n\nTotal Votes cast across all 5 seats:\nTory  = 141,310 = 52.6%\nLabour = 63,556 = 23.7%\nLib Dem = 53,515 = 19.9%\nGreen = 5,636 = 2.1%\nOther  = 4,393 = 1.6%\nTotal Votes = 268,410\n\nSo under this new system, for every 20% you get one seat, so all those above 20% get the first seats:\nTory 2 (40%) seats, leaving (52.6 - 40) 12.6% remaining\nLabour 1 seat, leaving (23.7 - 20) 3.7% remaining\n\nSo 3 of 5 seats already won. Now no party has 20% left, so next 2 seats go to the highest remaining totals, which are:\nLib Dem (19.9%)\nand Tory (12.6%)\n\nSo the 5 seats would be:\nTory 3 (60% of seats from 52.5% of vote)\nLabour 1 (20% of seats from 23.7% of vote)\nLib Dem 1 (20% of seats from 19.9% of vote)\n\nTories still get a majority, but now other parties get their deserved representation too. Instead of having (100 - 52.6) 47.4% \"ignored\" votes, under this system its only (3.7 + 2.1 + 1.6) 7.4% \"ignored\". This really would incentivise more voters to actually vote, as each vote has a far higher chance of actually counting, even in a very one-party place such as this.
