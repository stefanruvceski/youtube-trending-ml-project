In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn’t do much about it.Unless… we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, Имяя Фамилияя, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, Máté Szabó, Kasper Kylmälä, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

Which isn’t bad for a species with an average lifespan of 72 years. There was also a cat that set the record for the feline community by living to 38 years. Yet dogs aren’t so lucky, which means we humans, who’ve dubbed these loveable creatures as our best friends, really feel the sting. A 13-year-old person has their whole life ahead of them, yet a 13-year-old dog is considered a senior at that age! While we humans take up to 18 years to stop growing and developing, a dog is usually full-grown at 18 months!

Large dogs 5:42Circling before lying down 7:56Rolling around in the grass 8:11#dogs #pets #brightsideSUMMARY:- Most dogs live on average from 10 to 13 years, depending on the breed, of course.- For the 1st year of their life, dogs age 15 human years! Then they age about 4 human years with each birthday. - Aristotle believed that elephants lived longer than mice because they contained more liquid. Of course, the moisture thing wasn’t right, but his observations were pretty accurate overall: bigger animals do tend to live longer than smaller ones.- But let’s consider our parrot friends. They have an average lifespan of 20 to 50 years! - Larger species living longer could simply be a result of where they stand on the food chain.  It takes elephants longer to grow because hardly anyone would dare to attack them, right?- Humans and canines have been friends for thousands of years. DNA suggests that wolves and dogs split around 100,000 years ago. - There’s a theory suggesting that dogs don’t live as long because they’re just so sociable! They live in packs, right? The way it usually goes is when a species lives in groups, they’re more likely to spread illnesses.- Large species like Saint Bernards and German Shepherds are more prone to hip dysplasia. Siberian Huskies can often develop immune problems. - Also, some breeds are younger than others, and they haven’t had enough time to evolve. The good thing is that our favorite animals are living longer these days than they used to. - Does your dog take a treat or a big cheekful of food from its bowl only to carry into another room to eat? Like a lot of strange things your dog does, it’s ancient instincts controlling their brain.- And that circling ritualistic thing they do before they lie down? Spinning in circles might happen for several reasons. - What about rolling around in the grass? When they smell something in the grass they can hunt, they’ll use the grass to mask their own scent and sneak up on their prey.

Landing is scheduled at 7:57 a.m. EST on Sunday, Dec. 22. After its launch on Dec. 20, the Starliner did not reach the planned orbit and will not dock to the International Space Station. Teams worked quickly to ensure the spacecraft was in a stable orbit and preserved enough fuel for a landing opportunity."

I'm back with another episode of squishy makeovers. This is a good one! I made some creations, I'm really proud of, I hope you guys like them just as much as I do.Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.
