Rick Shiels heads to the Quest Golf Academy to test the drivers and see if they do actually hit the golf ball longer, hit the golf ball straight and help swing the golf club faster. Rick tests the driver using Titleist PRO V1 golf balls and Foresight GC Quad. Rick then takes the Callaway Mavrik Driver on the course against the Callaway Epic Flash Driver from 2019 to see if the claim of gaining 5 more yards is actually true. The Callaway Mavrik Driver, Callaway Mavrik Subzero Driver and Callaway Mavrik Max Driver will be played by golfers on The European Tour, The PGA Tour as well as The Masters, The USPGA, The US Open and The Open. Some of the best golfers in the world such as Phil Mickelson, Xander Schauffelle, Danny Willett, Francesco Molinari and Henrik Stenson will be using the new drivers BUT are they actually any better than the Callaway Epic Flash?

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video."

With Omaze you could win an M8 Competition plus $20,000 cash while supporting a good cause: http://bit.ly/Win-2020-BMW-M8In advance of my BMW M8 Competition arriving in a few months, BMW UK have very kindly allowed me to collect and drive their truly exclusive Gran Coupe First Edition 1 of 8. The limited run of just 8 cars come as a pre-production a few months ahead of the 4-door Gran Coupe even entering series production to begin with! The spec stays very closely to the original M8 concept with some amazing and unique touches added.The M8 GC 1 of 8 is painted in Aurora Diamon Gruen (Aurora Diamond Green), an iridescent green/blue flip representing the Northern Lights which are viewable from 8 countries; hence the 8 cars. The accents for the grille, badges and wheels are in Bronze Gold with an interior in brown leather featuring multiple touches from BMW Individual Manufaktur. My favourite touch though are the BMW Laser headlights featuring homologated yellow lights to represent those of the racecars and sportscars of the past.The M8 Gran Coupe itself is powered by the 4.4l TwinPower Turbo V8 making 625hp with the M xDrive system with 4WD and 2WD switchable modes. Meanwhile it adds plenty of space for the rear passengers compared to the 2-door siblings from the 8 Series family but with all the driving finesse you could desire.With a list price touching on ¬£160,000, it is also the most expensive new BMW model ever made, and with only 8 units it is also one of the absolute rarest and most exclusive! To pick up this work of art, we join @Shmarc150 in his heavily modified M2 Competition to head over to Berry Heathrow BMW to meet with Tony @trldeals and Joe @joeachilles for the handover and first drive.For your chance to win a 2020 BMW M8 Competition with$20,000 and support the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, enter at http://omaze.com/shmee150Thanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150"

So if any of you have any knowledge of what kind of techniques or products I can use to prep different painting surfaces, please let me know!Also, if you guys really love any of the phone case designs, I could work on getting the design printed on actual phone cases to put in my shop!

When Gotham‚Äôs most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.  Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya‚Äôs paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.  In the Warner Bros.

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world‚Äôs greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb"

But what really got me were the emotional moments. I kid you not, I shed a couple tears tonight!What‚Äôs up? It‚Äôs Drew Dorsey here with Clevver News and award season is officially underway!There were so many moments to talk about, but I‚Äôm here to talk about the tear jerking moments. And grab your tissues because emotions were running high!Let‚Äôs start with Tom Hanks who was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille award.It was a huge honor and just the montage before his acceptance speech was enough to get me emotional. But his speech set me over the edge.When he thanked his wife there wasn‚Äôt a dry eye in the audience or at home. You have to see it for yourself.I mean, my heart can‚Äôt take it! And neither could fans on Twitter.One person said quote, ‚ÄúHARD TO NOT CRY WHEN TOM HANKS CRIES.‚ÄùAnd another said quote, ‚ÄúI MEAN. WOW. #TomHanks is a worldwide treasure and we need to protect him at all costs. Also, excuse me while I wipe up the entire lake of tears I shed during his speech. @tomhanks‚ÄùBRB still crying over this entire moment.And if that wasn‚Äôt enough to make you shed a tear, let‚Äôs talk about Kate McKinnon presenting Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award.She opened up about how Ellen made her feel comfortable with her sexuality and how she‚Äôs paved the way for many people in the LGBTQ+ community in Hollywood.And fans are really connecting with this moment as well.One person tweeted saying quote, ‚ÄúI became super emotional watching Ellen DeGeneres--that people sought to dim her light is unacceptable. All I can say is, Equality is non-negotiable. And @RepHartzler --your discriminatory + hateful views on the LGBTQ+ community have no place in Congress.‚ÄùAnd another said quote, ‚ÄúIt was amazing, and so was Kate Mckinnon‚Äôs introduction. It was just what I needed today. The world needs more Ellen‚Äôs.‚ÄùAnd we couldn‚Äôt agree more!The last emotional moment we will talk about for today, because I don‚Äôt want you all crying too much, is Jennifer Anniston talking about the Australian fires.Many celebs brought attention to the tragic fires that are currently happening in Australia.Jenn read Russell Crowe‚Äôs acceptance speech for him because he is back home in Australia helping his family affected by the fires.She got choked up when reading it and fans talked about this moment on Twitter.One fan tweeted saying quote, ‚ÄúNo, YOU were getting emotional watching Jennifer Aniston fighting off tears reading Russell Crowe's acceptance speech on the Australia fires.‚ÄùAnd another said quote, ‚ÄúJennifer Aniston did a superb job hosting and reading out Russel Crowe‚Äôs message with sincerity and empathy‚ÄùAnd we totally get it. The fires are tragic and we‚Äôd like to help however we can.In our description we‚Äôve linked some ways to donate and get involved. Please consider donating if you are able to!And I want to hear from you all which moment made you cry the most.Was it Tom Hanks or Kate McKinnon or someone else?Let me know down in the comments below.After that, why don‚Äôt you dive in to more Clevver News by hitting that subscribe button and click that bell so you don‚Äôt miss any of our new stories.
