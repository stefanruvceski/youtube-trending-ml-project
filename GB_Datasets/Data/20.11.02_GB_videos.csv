Now. Because this was a surprise performance and‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not 2003, many people were caught off guard.In fact, at the award show, the camera panned over to a few celebrities that shared exactly how they were feeling about this surprise, through their faces alone. Starting off, with Indina Menzel. Who, honestly, just looked perplexed.Then of course there was Martin Scorsese who appeared to be so relaxed by the performance that he started to fall asleep.And lastly, there was Billie Eillish and her brother Fineas, who both, similar to Indina, looked absolutely baffled.Follow:http://www.twitter.com/reneearielhttp://www.instagram.com/reneearielhttp://www.twitter.com/fionazaringhttp://www.instagram.com/fionazaringSharing is Caring..."

Little did I know Xavier would beat all the odds and that we would get to know each other and become brothers. Over three months of getting to know him, he taught me about what it means to fight for your life, to love unconditionally and to appreciate every single breath. He always wanted to start a YouTube channel and I told him that no matter what, his story would be told. He took comfort in that. Here is that story. I know he's here with us. I know he's watching this video and smiling at these beautiful moments we got to spend with each other. I miss him and I know I'll see him again one day. Thank you for watching.

I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReviewAs they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

I think I'm kind of obsessed with these custom paint palettes. Don't forget to try it out yourself and tag my on instagram!NEW Phone cases!

Working in the shadow of an esteemed police veteran (Samuel L.
