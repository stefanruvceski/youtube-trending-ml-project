Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) get the expensive parts and Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) get the cheap ones. Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. If you want more power out of your Z, you really have to go forced induction. Which basically means, forcing more air into the engine to get more combustion. So in this episode we're installing turbochargers.Hi Team went with a Jim Wolf Technologies twin turbo kit. It’s high quality across the board. Best materials, it’s been through lots of R&D, everything should bolt up easily. But it’s $8000 DOLLARS! That’s more than we paid for the actual car! Can that possibly be worth it?It comes with two Garrett GT25 turbos. Garrett is one of the most trusted brands of turbo. It also comes with all the piping, plumbing and pieces you could ever ask for. Sometimes with these kits, the plumbing won’t fit quite right so you’ll find yourself having to do fabrication or calling your friend who knows how to weld. But with this expensive kit, theoretically everything should bolt right up and we won’t have to get our Tinker Boyz on. Part of that $8000 price tag. It was designed to be an OEM+ set-up with OEM reliability in mind, which means it shouldn’t require a lot of attention from you once its in--another benefit. It comes with its’ own piggyback box which talks with the car’s ECU or computer, and the right one can save you a lot of time and effort.These turbos are good for up to 530 hp, which is beneficial in two ways. If you do choose to go FULL hot boi down the line, you won’t need to upgrade your turbos, you can just keep these. The other benefit is that because these are way more than what we’re going to be throwing at them, they’re not likely to be a failure point.Team Low went with a Rev9 turbo kit, purchased on Amazon for $2400. It’s a single turbo kit. It comes with a turbonetics 60-1 turbo and a turbonetics evolution 38mm external wastegate. That’s one of the reasons we chose this kit. The turbocharger itself is the part of any turbo kit that is the most likely to fail. So even though this kit is “cheap”, I know with a name-brand, at least the turbo itself should be fine.This kit only includes the hard parts and doesn’t come with any software to help tell the ECU what’s going on. So in addition to the kit, we also had to buy an UpRev software license.We’re gonna show you our super long journey to get these things installed, then we dyno them to see who makes more power!Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

Oliver returned home to Starling City, bent on righting the wrongs of his family and fighting injustice. To do this, he created the persona of The Arrow and allied himself with former military man John Diggle, computer-science expert Felicity Smoak, lawyer-turned-vigilante Laurel Lance, billionaire inventor Ray Palmer, and his sister Thea Queen. After years of denying himself his own life as Oliver Queen in order to be The Arrow, Oliver left Starling City with Felicity and made a home in suburbia. But their newly tranquil lives are upended when an evil new organization, H.I.V.E., takes over the newly-christened Star City. Oliver is forced to don the hood once more…but can he keep his aim as The Arrow without losing the life he has fought so hard to get back?Connect with ARROW Online:Visit ARROW WEBSITE: http://www.cwtv.com/shows/arrowLike ARROW on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/cwarrowFollow ARROW on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/cw_arrowFollow ARROW on INSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/cw_arrowFollow ARROW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw/arrowFollow ARROW on TUMBLR: http://thecwarrow.tumblr.com#ArrowAbout The CW:Official YouTube Channel for The CW Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as Black Lightning, The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, The 100, Dynasty, In the Dark, and Roswell, New Mexico.Connect with The CW Online:Visit The CW WEBSITE: http://cwtv.comLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecwFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecwFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecwFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.comFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecwArrow | Season 8 Episode 9 | Green Arrow & The Canaries Promo | The CWhttps://www.youtube.com/TheCW"

Rick Shiels heads to the Quest Golf Academy to test the drivers and see if they do actually hit the golf ball longer, hit the golf ball straight and help swing the golf club faster. Rick tests the driver using Titleist PRO V1 golf balls and Foresight GC Quad. Rick then takes the Callaway Mavrik Driver on the course against the Callaway Epic Flash Driver from 2019 to see if the claim of gaining 5 more yards is actually true. The Callaway Mavrik Driver, Callaway Mavrik Subzero Driver and Callaway Mavrik Max Driver will be played by golfers on The European Tour, The PGA Tour as well as The Masters, The USPGA, The US Open and The Open. Some of the best golfers in the world such as Phil Mickelson, Xander Schauffelle, Danny Willett, Francesco Molinari and Henrik Stenson will be using the new drivers BUT are they actually any better than the Callaway Epic Flash?

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment.

With Omaze you could win an M8 Competition plus $20,000 cash while supporting a good cause: http://bit.ly/Win-2020-BMW-M8In advance of my BMW M8 Competition arriving in a few months, BMW UK have very kindly allowed me to collect and drive their truly exclusive Gran Coupe First Edition 1 of 8. The limited run of just 8 cars come as a pre-production a few months ahead of the 4-door Gran Coupe even entering series production to begin with! The spec stays very closely to the original M8 concept with some amazing and unique touches added.The M8 GC 1 of 8 is painted in Aurora Diamon Gruen (Aurora Diamond Green), an iridescent green/blue flip representing the Northern Lights which are viewable from 8 countries; hence the 8 cars. The accents for the grille, badges and wheels are in Bronze Gold with an interior in brown leather featuring multiple touches from BMW Individual Manufaktur. My favourite touch though are the BMW Laser headlights featuring homologated yellow lights to represent those of the racecars and sportscars of the past.The M8 Gran Coupe itself is powered by the 4.4l TwinPower Turbo V8 making 625hp with the M xDrive system with 4WD and 2WD switchable modes. Meanwhile it adds plenty of space for the rear passengers compared to the 2-door siblings from the 8 Series family but with all the driving finesse you could desire.With a list price touching on £160,000, it is also the most expensive new BMW model ever made, and with only 8 units it is also one of the absolute rarest and most exclusive! To pick up this work of art, we join @Shmarc150 in his heavily modified M2 Competition to head over to Berry Heathrow BMW to meet with Tony @trldeals and Joe @joeachilles for the handover and first drive.For your chance to win a 2020 BMW M8 Competition with$20,000 and support the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, enter at http://omaze.com/shmee150Thanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150"

In ‘Bondi Rescue’ the audience sees the action through the eyes of real characters and lifeguards like Hoppo, Deano, Reidy, Jesse, Maxy, Whippet and Harries, as they catch thieves, perform CPR, make drug busts, break up fights, and even handle a navy bomb that washes ashore one afternoon.

So if any of you have any knowledge of what kind of techniques or products I can use to prep different painting surfaces, please let me know!Also, if you guys really love any of the phone case designs, I could work on getting the design printed on actual phone cases to put in my shop!

I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here.
