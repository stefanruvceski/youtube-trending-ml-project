It's over a quarter of a century I've been doing this.The Brexit Party leader said the result has finally sunk in and admitted that what kept him going was pure pigheaded obstinacy and a desire not to be proven wrong.Nigel promised to sing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's praises if he gets Brexit right and sound the alarm bells if he gets it wrong.#NigelFarage #Brexit #LBCLBC is the home of live debate around news and current affairs.

To save 20%, enter MORIAH at checkout ––http://bit.ly/HUM_moriahSo today is a weird video. I've had this video planned for SUCH a long time LOL. I bought the book back in June, and I've been waiting for just the right occasion. Also, I needed time to collect the hair off my cat haha. I ended up not needed that much...I have quite a bit of fur left over. So if anyone needs a buttload of coffee colored cat hair, I gotcha covered 😂 I did have fun making this very weird cat themed craft. It's been awhile since I've straight-up crafted at all, so I guess making cat finger puppets was the perfect way to come back? If you're ever bored and want to make some unique crafts with supplies you have at home (if you have a cat), then I recommend trying this. Then give away your cat hair projects as gifts...your family and friends will loooove them and definitely not be weirded out at all. 😝 THIS IS THE LAST DAY TO ORDER PICKLE THE DINOSAUR. He is an exclusive collector's item and will be very rare and difficult to find after today.ORDER HERE: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/SimplyNailogical's Cat Hair Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hKjVRYmrRkIn case you want to craft with your own cat:The Crafting With Cat Hair Book: https://amzn.to/2uNF2gW*affiliate link*___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

I love anything vocal/singing related and geek out on it every day.  I want to motivate and inspire others to follow their dreams…corny? Well maybe but it’s true. So what’s motivating me?? I had a huge tumour removed summer 2017 and my ovaries and fallopian tubes. The tumour was the size of a 20 week baby!!  However, despite not being able to walk for a couple of weeks, and feeling generally awful…. It has made me create and do what I love! It wasn’t an easy time but I won’t let fear dictate my life. I didn’t think ‘why me’, there are plenty of horrific issues people have to deal with…it’s not always smooth sailing.  It’s true when you hear, ‘Life is short’, the crazy thing is, I am glad it happened…I appreciate life even more and practice gratitude everyday…It’s so easy to get caught up with the little things…and I do sometimes, but look at the bigger picture, will it matter in a year or two…? Also thank you for all your support. It means a lot. Subscribe to Rebecca Vocal Athlete to get inspired by new videos!Have a great day!!Rebecca Xx"
