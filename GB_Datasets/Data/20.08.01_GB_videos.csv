The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world‚Äôs greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb"

In this video, I‚Äôm going to show you how to never do them incorrectly again and give you the fixes for the 10 most common pullup mistakes.  Whether you can do 10 pull-ups or more now or struggle to do one, you‚Äôll find this incredibly helpful and I guarantee you will be doing more reps by the time the video is over.The first thing you need to be aware of is how you are gripping the bar. If you grip too narrow you will shift the focus of the movement from the stronger back muscles to the weaker muscles of the forearms. You want to make sure you are just outside of shoulder width with the hand placement for optimal performance on this exercise.That said, the brachioradialis and brachialis are muscles that are going to be contributing to the pullup and your ability to do the most reps possible so you are going to need to train them. You just don‚Äôt want them being the main drivers of the exercise. To supplement your back muscles in the exercise, be sure to include some cross body hammer curls as shown to increase the strength of the forearms and your overall strength on the pullup.Regarding the grip placement, it isn‚Äôt enough to just get the hand spacing down. You also want to be sure that you direct your pressure in the right way. Most people simply pull straight down on the bar or worse, they pull outwards because they‚Äôve been told this will increase the activation of the lats. Both of these aren‚Äôt optimal. The best thing you can do is squeeze your hands inward towards each other and down at the same time. This will engage much more upper body muscle activation that will make your body feel as if it is floating up above the bar on every rep, instantly.Much of this has to do with plugging kinetic looseness (or energy leaks as I call them). You can take this even a step further by contracting other areas of your body that often get ignored during the exercise like your legs, ankles and core. Instead of dangling from the bar and letting your knees hang loosely, tighten you quads, point your feet down and really contract your core muscles and you will see an instant improvement in your ability to lift your body up over the bar.Now you don‚Äôt want to take these measures and then let it all loosen up when you get to the bottom of the rep. Most importantly, you do not want to get lax during the hanging portion of the pullup. This will place too much strain on the shoulders and is called unpacking. Instead, even though you want to get fully straightened at the elbows you want to keep your shoulder blades pulled down and back to create shoulder stability. This will allow for a lifetime of injury free pullups and more growth from the exercise.There are other biomechanical flaws that you will want to avoid with your pullups that I cover here but I also want to point out a couple of the programming issues that are often done incorrectly as well. For instance, you don‚Äôt want to always save your pullups for the end of your workout. Too often, because they are a bodyweight exercise, we save them for after we have already done our rows, deadlifts or pulldowns. You will never get the most out of the exercise when done in a fatigued state like this. Try moving them to the front of your workout and you will be surprised at how quickly you see gains just by making the switch.Finally, the exercise like any other, will respond to intensification techniques like drop sets and changes in the weight used during it. Use a band to accommodate your fatigue and get more total reps done in a workout - either as a drop set or as a simple lightening of the load as you would with any other traditional back exercise in your workout.If you‚Äôre looking for a program that will help you to do many more pullups while at the same time getting you in the best overall shape of your life, head to athleanx.com at the link below and follow the same step by step training that has created ripped athletic bodies for men and women of all ages and all levels of athleticism.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong.

I surprised my dad with a new car and he did not expect it at all!  We saved over 75% off of MSRP by not buying it from the dealership! With luxury cars it's better to let someone else buy it new and take the huge depreciation hit first. Then you can buy it at an amazing price with low mileage and just a few years old.
