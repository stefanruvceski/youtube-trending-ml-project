He was suffering from a rare form of liver cancer and doctors had given up hope. After hearing his story, I knew I wanted to meet him. Little did I know Xavier would beat all the odds and that we would get to know each other and become brothers. Over three months of getting to know him, he taught me about what it means to fight for your life, to love unconditionally and to appreciate every single breath. He always wanted to start a YouTube channel and I told him that no matter what, his story would be told. He took comfort in that. Here is that story. I know he's here with us. I know he's watching this video and smiling at these beautiful moments we got to spend with each other. I miss him and I know I'll see him again one day. Thank you for watching.

Working in the shadow of an esteemed police veteran (Samuel L. Jackson), brash Detective Ezekiel ‚ÄúZeke‚Äù Banks (Chris Rock) and his rookie partner (Max Minghella) take charge of a grisly investigation into murders that are eerily reminiscent of the city‚Äôs gruesome past.  Unwittingly entrapped in a deepening mystery, Zeke finds himself at the center of the killer‚Äôs morbid game.SPIRAL stars Chris Rock, Max Minghella, Marisol Nichols, and Samuel L.
