A few months ago, I found out that Amazon started offering a personal shopping service. That's right, Amazon was styling people for a small fee each month - so I figured, we had to try it out to see what kind of clothing & accessories they would send me, and if they would be any good. So we took a quiz and good ole' Bezos sent me a sack of clothes. What do you guys think of my Amazon personal shopper haul? EDIT (for clarity) - although I eliminated most color options in the quiz, I did leave on every pattern except animal print, I said that I often wear edgy styles and I also liked boho styles, said that I would try pretty much every trend except for animal print and cropped pants, and clicked yes on multiple silhouettes and clothing items - so they had plenty of optionality! just in case you guys missed some answers!This video is NOT sponsored!You can check out our Colourpop frankenlipsticks here! https://colourpop.com/collections/safiya-nygaard-makeupSafiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/Check out our merch here: https://fiendsbysaf.com/If your size is sold out, sign up for email updates!MUSICVia AudioNetworkAssistant EditorsEmily Linden & Josie Latino"

They’re all important parts of the tale of the axion - a tale whose end may take us beyond the standard model and solve one of the most vexing mysteries in astrophysics. Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'Dowd & Graeme GosselGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealPost Production: Yago Ballarini, Max Willians, Pedro OsinskiDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberThe story of the axion is a classic physics tale: intrepid scientists delve deep into trackless mathematics in search of answers to a mystery. And there, against all expectations, they find the hint of a completely new and unexpected denizen of the natural world. In this case the mystery was a subtle inconsistency in the behavior of the fundamental forces. And the unexpected discovery? A brand new particle - the axion - which, while not proven to exist, may explain a much more famous conundrum. The axion may explain dark matter.

What truths about the past await Elsa as she ventures into the unknown to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond Arendelle? The answers are calling her but also threatening her kingdom. Together with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven, she'll face a dangerous but remarkable journey. In “Frozen,” Elsa feared her powers were too much for the world. In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough.

Starting off, with Indina Menzel. Who, honestly, just looked perplexed.Then of course there was Martin Scorsese who appeared to be so relaxed by the performance that he started to fall asleep.And lastly, there was Billie Eillish and her brother Fineas, who both, similar to Indina, looked absolutely baffled.Follow:http://www.twitter.com/reneearielhttp://www.instagram.com/reneearielhttp://www.twitter.com/fionazaringhttp://www.instagram.com/fionazaringSharing is Caring..."

He was suffering from a rare form of liver cancer and doctors had given up hope. After hearing his story, I knew I wanted to meet him. Little did I know Xavier would beat all the odds and that we would get to know each other and become brothers. Over three months of getting to know him, he taught me about what it means to fight for your life, to love unconditionally and to appreciate every single breath. He always wanted to start a YouTube channel and I told him that no matter what, his story would be told. He took comfort in that. Here is that story. I know he's here with us. I know he's watching this video and smiling at these beautiful moments we got to spend with each other. I miss him and I know I'll see him again one day. Thank you for watching.

I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReviewAs they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

Today I am painting on paint palettes. Yep, that's right. It's weird, but also somehow makes completes sense at the same time. I decorated 8 different paint palettes and am using them as decor in my art room. I tried to paint a mix of abstract designs, landscape, cartoony etc. in order to get a good variety for you guys using acrylic paint and posca paint pens. I hope you guys like this new idea! I think I'm kind of obsessed with these custom paint palettes. Don't forget to try it out yourself and tag my on instagram!NEW Phone cases! I asked you guys if you wanted me to have my painted phone case designs re-produced and you did!
