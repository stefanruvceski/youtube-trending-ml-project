I'm back with another episode of squishy makeovers. This is a good one! I made some creations, I'm really proud of, I hope you guys like them just as much as I do.Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

YouTube is sending us all a message with this rewind, and all of its responses to the recent changes on the platform, that it is not one of us Creators.

Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! One day, Beck received a message from her friend about someone she should add on social media. Beck didn't know the person, but her friend told her that if she connected with him, he would give her free money online. Beck decided to go for it - the idea of free money got her really excited. When she added the man, he started messaging her and offering her money right away. He promised to treat her right, but then he started asking her weird questions. He asked her for her shoe size, height, age - lots of personal details about Beck. Beck responded, but she gave him fake information. Then, the man asked Beck for inappropriate pictures she wasn't comfortable with. When she denied his request, he responded by saying that he would still give her the money if she sent his profile to 5 of her friends that were girls - they HAD to be girls. The promise of free money was too hard for her to pass up, so she sent his information to some friends. Some of her friends thought it was sketchy and didn't add him, but some of them did. When it was time for Beck to get the money he promised her, he asked her for her address. Then, at that moment, Beck made a big mistake - she sent him her REAL address. Beck's friends freaked out and started telling him that her address was fake, which made him extremely angry. He started sending Beck scary, threatening messages. At that point, Beck realized she made a huge mistake. Beck decided to show her school officer the messages and screen shots, and Beck's school decided to call the police. Beck was even more upset when the police told her that the man she was talking to was likely a criminal, and the whole situation was really scary for her. She regretted giving out any personal information, and the entire experience taught her what it means to stay safe online.When she looks back now, she can say to herself, A stranger offered me money on social media - and it taught me an important lesson.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

It's delicious. Especially when you learn to make this simple recipe yourself. Or when you manipulate a friend to make beef chili for you. Also, beans.

Break it up in the pan then let it sit until a crust starts to form, then flip and do the same thing again Dice a large onion and chop it up Do the same with three cloves of garlicHeat your chili pot on medium with some olive oil then saut√© the onion until it starts to brownThrow the garlic in during the last couple of minutesThen add the beef with a teaspoon of salt and break it up moreAdd in 28oz/790g crushed tomatoes2 tablespoon chili powder1 tablespoon cumin 1 to 1.5 cups beef broth‚Ä¶adjust as necessary ¬Ω tablespoon of brown sugar15.5oz/439g chatty bastard kidney beansThen add hot sauce or more spice as desired. Then add toppings, which don‚Äôt count as chili ingredients, because they are on top, not inside. They‚Äôre not really a part of the chili. The chili is it‚Äôs own thing. It‚Äôs like calling ketchup a hot dog. Ketchup isn‚Äôt a hot dog. It‚Äôs ketchup. It has it‚Äôs own life. Don‚Äôt argue with me here. It will get you nowhere and it will just waste both of our times.

Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. This led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   But the big picture conceals  the details. Let us look at one region in particular: Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. So is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?
