When Aliyah was 15 years old, she moved in with her mother after her father passed away. It was so difficult for her to deal with her loss, and to make things even more stressful, Aliyah had to go to a brand new school after her move. On her first day, she was so scared to start her new high school and meet new people. She was really shy. But one day, she met a boy named Aaron. Aaron knew Aliyah's mom through his job, so they immediately had a connection. They became really good friends, and they eventually started dating. They got really close, and Aliyah ended up falling deeply in love with him. He was her first boyfriend and real relationship. One day, when Aaron and Aliyah were home alone, after watching anime, playing video games and hanging out, they decided to take their relationship to the next level. They went to her room, and one thing led to another.  A few weeks later, Aliyah was with her best friend when she started to feel a pain in her stomach. When she went to the bathroom, she realized that she was experiencing a pregnancy symptom. She immediately got really nervous, so she called Aaron and he brought her a pregnancy test. Aliyah took the test a few times, and she became even more nervous and confused when the results were both positive and negative. She didn't know if she was pregnant. Aliyah went to the doctor with her mom to get an official test. After waiting nervously, Aliyah finally got the results - she was not pregnant. Even though she had mixed emotions at first, Aliyah decided that everything ultimately worked out for the best. She did not feel ready to have a baby and become a mother at the time. When she looks back, she probably says to herself, My pregnancy scare was a moment I'll never forget.

After a long wait, how better to collect the new supercar than for the first time using my AMG G63 with a trailer to transport it to Topaz for PPF to be installed. There's going to be a lot of adventures to come with the Pro, I can't wait! Kicking off from the garage, the first stop is to take my AMG G63 over to Topaz, where the Skin was installed, but also to meet with Tony from Turbo Transport to hook up the trailer with which we're going to be collecting the new car. Having passed my test earlier in the summer for towing this type of setup, it's time to finally put it to use and how better than one AMG to collect another!?Logistically, a meet point at Topaz would make our day flow best, but also mean that Tony would be able to show me the ropes and help with the actual work to load and transport the new GT R Pro. We set off then to head towards Mercedes-Benz Brentford to take a first look at the new Shmeemobile.On display sits the GT R Pro, one of only 750 total cars being made, with mine in designo Diamond White paintwork with the satin grey decals to contrast the main colour, along with the titanium RXE wheels and the exposed visual carbon fibre. Powered by the 4.0l TT V8, the Pro shares a similar setup to the G63 with 585hp but features a 7spd dual clutch as opposed to the 9spd auto used by the G for extra torque and off-roading.Why not just drive it? Well as always with my cars, to prevent the risk of stone chips or damage, the car is immediately going to Topaz for the very best installation of Paint Protection Film to ensure it is always going to be in perfect shape. With horrible weather, and weird things happening on the roads around the time of year, not only does it protect the car but also gives an opportunity to use the G63 to tow. As such we unload back at Topaz before Tony is back on his way and it's time for the GT R Pro to head inside for detailing and the PPF install which we will see over the coming week or two.If you're interested to know more about finance, and/or receive a quote, take a look at Shmee150 Finance powered by Harrington: http://www.shmee150finance.comA special thanks to GT (my salesman at MB Brentford), to Topaz and of course to Turbo Tony for his time to show me the ropes for my first towing outing, give him a follow here:http://instagram.com/turbotransportThanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150"
