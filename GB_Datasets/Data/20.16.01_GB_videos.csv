One night, he makes the mistake of drunkenly dropping an inflammatory barb on a broadcast of Skizm, an illegal death-match fight club streamed live to the public. In response, Riktor (Ned Dennehy), the maniacal mastermind behind the channel, decides to force Miles' hand (or hands, as it were) and have him join the fun. Miles wakes to find heavy pistols bolted into his bones, and learns Nix (Samara Weaving), the trigger-happy star of Skizm, is his first opponent. Gleefully echoing elements of Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the Purge franchise, and videogames like Mortal Kombat, Guns Akimbo is hilariously dark, viciously violent, and potentially — chillingly — prescient. Director Jason Lei Howden (Deathgasm) foretells of a future that may soon await us: drone-captured live feeds, UFC-like competitions pushed to an extreme, and online streaming platforms used for gladiatorial entertainment all around the world. As Miles navigates the underworld of Skizm, the stakes — and the ratings — have never been higher. #GunsAkimbo #DanielRadcliffe #SamaraWeavingIn Cinemas March 5th 2020Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/madmanfilmsTwitter: http://twitter.com/madmanfilms Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/madmanfilms"

The planet, called TOI 1338b, is around 6.9 times larger than Earth, or between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn. It lies in a system 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Pictor.The stars in the system make an eclipsing binary, which occurs when the stellar companions circle each other in our plane of view. One is about 10% more massive than our Sun, while the other is cooler, dimmer and only one-third the Sun’s mass. TOI 1338b’s transits are irregular, between every 93 and 95 days, and vary in depth and duration thanks to the orbital motion of its stars. TESS only sees the transits crossing the larger star — the transits of the smaller star are too faint to detect. Although the planet transits irregularly, its orbit is stable for at least the next 10 million years. The orbit’s angle to us, however, changes enough that the planet transit will cease after November 2023 and resume eight years later.Read more: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-mission-uncovers-its-1st-world-with-two-stars Music: Albatross from Universal Production Music.Video credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight CenterChris Smith (USRA): Lead ProducerChris Smith (USRA): Lead AnimatorJeanette Kazmierczak (University of Maryland College Park): Lead Science WriterChris Smith (USRA): WriterVeselin Kostov (NASA Postdoctoral Fellow): ScientistThis video is public domain and along with other supporting visualizations can be downloaded from NASA Goddard's Scientific Visualization Studio at: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13510If you liked this video, subscribe to the NASA Goddard YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/NASAGoddardFollow NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center· Instagram http://www.instagram.com/nasagoddard· Twitter http://twitter.com/NASAGoddard· Twitter http://twitter.com/NASAGoddardPix· Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/NASAGoddard· Flickr http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc"

Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) get the expensive parts and Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) get the cheap ones. Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. If you want more power out of your Z, you really have to go forced induction. Which basically means, forcing more air into the engine to get more combustion. So in this episode we're installing turbochargers.Hi Team went with a Jim Wolf Technologies twin turbo kit. It’s high quality across the board. Best materials, it’s been through lots of R&D, everything should bolt up easily. But it’s $8000 DOLLARS! That’s more than we paid for the actual car! Can that possibly be worth it?It comes with two Garrett GT25 turbos. Garrett is one of the most trusted brands of turbo. It also comes with all the piping, plumbing and pieces you could ever ask for. Sometimes with these kits, the plumbing won’t fit quite right so you’ll find yourself having to do fabrication or calling your friend who knows how to weld. But with this expensive kit, theoretically everything should bolt right up and we won’t have to get our Tinker Boyz on. Part of that $8000 price tag. It was designed to be an OEM+ set-up with OEM reliability in mind, which means it shouldn’t require a lot of attention from you once its in--another benefit. It comes with its’ own piggyback box which talks with the car’s ECU or computer, and the right one can save you a lot of time and effort.These turbos are good for up to 530 hp, which is beneficial in two ways. If you do choose to go FULL hot boi down the line, you won’t need to upgrade your turbos, you can just keep these. The other benefit is that because these are way more than what we’re going to be throwing at them, they’re not likely to be a failure point.Team Low went with a Rev9 turbo kit, purchased on Amazon for $2400. It’s a single turbo kit. It comes with a turbonetics 60-1 turbo and a turbonetics evolution 38mm external wastegate. That’s one of the reasons we chose this kit. The turbocharger itself is the part of any turbo kit that is the most likely to fail. So even though this kit is “cheap”, I know with a name-brand, at least the turbo itself should be fine.This kit only includes the hard parts and doesn’t come with any software to help tell the ECU what’s going on. So in addition to the kit, we also had to buy an UpRev software license.We’re gonna show you our super long journey to get these things installed, then we dyno them to see who makes more power!Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

Rick Shiels heads to the Quest Golf Academy to test the drivers and see if they do actually hit the golf ball longer, hit the golf ball straight and help swing the golf club faster. Rick tests the driver using Titleist PRO V1 golf balls and Foresight GC Quad. Rick then takes the Callaway Mavrik Driver on the course against the Callaway Epic Flash Driver from 2019 to see if the claim of gaining 5 more yards is actually true. The Callaway Mavrik Driver, Callaway Mavrik Subzero Driver and Callaway Mavrik Max Driver will be played by golfers on The European Tour, The PGA Tour as well as The Masters, The USPGA, The US Open and The Open. Some of the best golfers in the world such as Phil Mickelson, Xander Schauffelle, Danny Willett, Francesco Molinari and Henrik Stenson will be using the new drivers BUT are they actually any better than the Callaway Epic Flash?

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video."

With Omaze you could win an M8 Competition plus $20,000 cash while supporting a good cause: http://bit.ly/Win-2020-BMW-M8In advance of my BMW M8 Competition arriving in a few months, BMW UK have very kindly allowed me to collect and drive their truly exclusive Gran Coupe First Edition 1 of 8. The limited run of just 8 cars come as a pre-production a few months ahead of the 4-door Gran Coupe even entering series production to begin with! The spec stays very closely to the original M8 concept with some amazing and unique touches added.The M8 GC 1 of 8 is painted in Aurora Diamon Gruen (Aurora Diamond Green), an iridescent green/blue flip representing the Northern Lights which are viewable from 8 countries; hence the 8 cars. The accents for the grille, badges and wheels are in Bronze Gold with an interior in brown leather featuring multiple touches from BMW Individual Manufaktur. My favourite touch though are the BMW Laser headlights featuring homologated yellow lights to represent those of the racecars and sportscars of the past.The M8 Gran Coupe itself is powered by the 4.4l TwinPower Turbo V8 making 625hp with the M xDrive system with 4WD and 2WD switchable modes. Meanwhile it adds plenty of space for the rear passengers compared to the 2-door siblings from the 8 Series family but with all the driving finesse you could desire.With a list price touching on £160,000, it is also the most expensive new BMW model ever made, and with only 8 units it is also one of the absolute rarest and most exclusive! To pick up this work of art, we join @Shmarc150 in his heavily modified M2 Competition to head over to Berry Heathrow BMW to meet with Tony @trldeals and Joe @joeachilles for the handover and first drive.For your chance to win a 2020 BMW M8 Competition with$20,000 and support the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, enter at http://omaze.com/shmee150Thanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150"

Meet Harley Quinn, Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain. #BirdsOfPrey in theaters 2.7.20. https://www.facebook.com/BirdsOfPreyMovie https://twitter.com/birdsofpreywb https://www.instagram.com/BirdsOfPrey/ https://www.birdsofpreymovie.com/  You ever hear the one about the cop, the songbird, the psycho and the mafia princess?  “Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)” is a twisted tale told by Harley herself, as only Harley can tell it.  When Gotham’s most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.  Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya’s paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.  In the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Margot Robbie (“I, Tonya”) returns as Harley Quinn, alongside Mary Elizabeth Winstead (“10 Cloverfield Lane,” TV’s “Fargo”) as Huntress; Jurnee Smollett-Bell (HBO’s “True Blood”) as Black Canary; Rosie Perez (“Fearless,” “Pitch Perfect 2”) as Renee Montoya; Chris Messina (“Argo,” TV’s “Sharp Objects”) as Victor Zsasz; and Ewan McGregor (upcoming “Doctor Sleep,” the “Trainspotting” films) as Roman Sionis.

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998.
