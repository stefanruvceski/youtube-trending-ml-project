The authorities say four children have been infected, the first such cases in this county. Twelve people have died – all of them either elderly or with underlying health problems. Several cases in other European countries have been reported among people who have recently been in northern Italy. On a visit to Rome, the EU’s health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said the situation was a cause for concern but not for panic. Schools, universities, museums, cinemas and theatres remain closed across much of the north. A number of tourists have cancelled their visits. There are fears the outbreak could send Italy’s economy in recession.Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUogSeveral European countries have announced their first coronavirus cases, all apparently linked to the growing outbreak in Italy.Austria, Croatia and Switzerland said the cases involved people who had been to Italy, as did Algeria in Africa.The first positive virus test has been recorded in Latin America - a Brazilian resident just returned from Italy.Italy has in recent days become Europe's worst-affected country, with more than 300 cases and 11 deaths.But its neighbours have decided closing borders would be disproportionate.Health ministers from France, Germany, Italy and the EU Commission committed to keeping frontiers open at a meeting on Tuesday as new cases of the virus emerged throughout Europe and in central and southern Italy."

I'm back with another episode of squishy makeovers. This is a good one! I made some creations, I'm really proud of, I hope you guys like them just as much as I do.GEORGIE MERCH: https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/listing/georgie-5839?product=2Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are breaking free from the rules of how royals make money, which just might be a savvy financial decision.

TMZ has learned.The rapper was at a home in the Hollywood Hills at around 4:30 AM when 2 men wearing hoodies and masks broke into a house ... this according to law enforcement sources. We're told the 2 men fired multiple shots, striking and critically wounding Pop Smoke. The men were seen fleeing on foot.Pop Smoke was rushed by ambulance to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in West Hollywood where he was pronounced dead.The suspects have not been caught and as far as we know they have not been identified.  It's unclear if Pop Smoke knew the shooters. One man was placed in handcuffs but cops determined he was not involved and was released.Pop Smoke released an album back in July and one of the songs, Welcome to the Party, blew up ... it was considered by many the song of the summer. Nicki Minaj did a remix of the song a few months later. He also did a song, Gatti, with Travis Scott.6:56 AM PT -- The home is owned by Teddi Mellencamp's husband, Edwin Arroyave, who owns several homes in Los Angeles. It's possible Pop Smoke was renting the property.7:08 AM PT -- Nicki Minaj just posted a cryptic message ... The Bible tells us that jealousy is as cruel as the grave. Unbelievable. Rest in Peace, Pop. By using the term jealousy, she seems to be saying there's a connection between the killers and Pop Smoke. We have not heard this from our law enforcement sources.SUBSCRIBE: http://tmz.me/wONe5NOAbout TMZ:TMZ has consistently been credited for breaking the biggest stories dominating the entertainment news landscape and changed the way the public gets their news.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg makes his debate debut, as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders takes the lead in the polls.Just three days before the crucial Nevada caucuses, Democratic candidates took the stage in a contentious debate, firing off rounds of attacks on newcomer Mike Bloomberg.Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former New York Mayor Bloomberg spent two hours Wednesday night duking it out at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino.It was the ninth overall debate – and the most pugnacious. But it was the first that featured Bloomberg, who doesn’t take campaign contributions and did not qualify for previous ones because he didn’t meet donor thresholds.The debate opened with Warren and Sanders, who have built their campaigns around the promise to reduce wealth inequality, throwing jabs at Bloomberg, who has spent about $400 million of his personal fortune on campaign ads. since joining the race in late November. Despite his presence at the Nevada debate, Bloomberg is not on a ballot until Super Tuesday March 3.Sanders maintains a lead in national polls and held a 19-point edge in Nevada, according to a survey released Monday. The Nevada caucuses could present an opportunity for Biden, who maintained the lead for months, to bounce back against Sanders.However, Biden, the former front-runner, came across as mostly an afterthought in Wednesday’s debate. He is at risk of underperforming in Nevada on Saturday and the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29, after he flopped in Iowa and New Hampshire.For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Billie Eilish gave her first live performance of James Bond theme song ‘No Time To Die’, Lizzo killed it on stage with a medley of her hits, Maya Jama looked incredible on the red carpet, and Lewis Capaldi and his alcoholic beverages played a starring role.But, with it being a live broadcast and celebs being celebs, there were also some moments that people (ahem Jack Whitehall) are likely going to want to pretend never happened. From Jack asking about Harry Styles's date (it was his sister) to Lewis Capaldi getting bleeped, here are the most awkward moments from this year's ceremony.#BRITs #BRITS2020 #BritAwardsStill haven’t subscribed to Cosmo UK on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/CosmoSubscribeLike us on Facebook ►► https://www.facebook.com/cosmopolitanuk/ Follow us on Instagram ►► https://www.instagram.com/cosmopolitanuk/?hl=enFor more from Cosmo ►► http://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk"

The key to getting sweeping lats is to not only train your back with the right exercises but by making sure you are performing them the right way.That said, if you want to build a wider back and lats you have to do two very important things in your back workouts. First, you must be willing to take the exercises you are doing through a full range of motion. Simply focusing on the middle portion of every row, pullup and pulldown is not going to give you fully developed lats just as doing this with your curls will give you fully developed biceps.Beyond that, if you don’t ever focus on creating a peak contraction of the lats by digging your elbow into your hip at the bottom of every rep, then you won’t get the muscle to grow as much as it is capable of. Each of the lat exercises shown here will help you to do exactly this. They will take your lats through a full range of motion and get you to place extra emphasis on the contracted position of the muscle.The first exercise shown is called the tripod underhand row. It is important to note that the grip makes all the difference in the effectiveness of this exercise in targeting the lats. When you perform it with an overhand grip you shift most of the focus of the move to the muscles of your upper back rather than the latissimus. When you switch to a supinated grip your elbow becomes much easier to tuck into your side, drive towards your pelvis and ultimately obtain a greater contraction of the lats in their fully shortened state.The second exercise is the wide grip underhand pulldown. This one actually helps those that struggle to feel what it should feel like to get your elbows driven into your hips. Because the movement starts with your elbows out wide, the only place for them to travel is down and in closer to your hips and pelvis. The underhand position once again helps to allow the elbows to ultimately get closer to your sides and increase the contraction of the lats.The rocking pulldown is another awesome back exercise for building wider lats because it adds the additional ability to get rotation of the torso as you drive your arm down into your side. Being able to focus on one side at a time helps those that struggle to feel a strong contraction in the lats even more.If ever there was a face pull for your lats, the high cable row would be it. This allows you once again to train one side at a time in a very athletic manner - by standing on your feet with the ability to include rotation for a v-taper back. This enables you to separate your hips from your shoulders by rotating them in opposite directions which really increases the stretch on your lats and allows for a more powerful contraction. Not just that, the up and away position of the arm creates an even more significant stretch on the lats attachments which tends to allow the user to feel a stronger contraction of the lats at the end of each rep.The incline single arm stretch pulldown is an amazing lat exercise for growing a wider back. This setup does require that you have access to an incline bench and a cable apparatus, but if you do, it’s worth the extra effort. Here you can get an amazing stretch on the lats by letting your arm drift high up overhead, with a clear target for your elbow to be driven down towards your hip on every rep. The contraction you should feel on this in your lower lats will be intense if performed correctly.Finally, there is no better lat exercise for building straight arm scapular strength than the straight arm pushdown. Performin the move one arm at a time as shown in the video. Look to not just get to the level of your back but past it to really increase the squeeze on the lower lats in the bottom position.All of these lat exercises are great for building a wider back and lats. You do not have to do all of them to get results. In fact, if you mix in one or two with your standard heavy rows, weighted pullups and deadlifts, you will notice a wider back in no time.
