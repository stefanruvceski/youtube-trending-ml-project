But one of those borders is a little more complicated: the Mosel (or Moselle) river is a condominium, it belongs to both countries at the same time. And thus, so the bridges above it.REFERENCES:I'm not 100% happy with the research in this video, because it was put together quickly and, through necessity of language, from English-speaking secondary sources. However, Frank Jacobs in the New York Times on condominiums, talks about the history of the treaties: https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/the-worlds-most-exclusive-condominium/and that's confirmed by a reference in Freshwater Boundaries Revisited: Recent Developments in International River Law by Mar√≠a Querol, which quotes Bernhardt's Encyclopedia of Public International Law, Vol 111, p465.Interestingly, the borders on Google Maps, Bing Maps and OpenStreetMap all take different (and sometimes nonsensical) twists and turns, so I've chosen to illustrate the simplest example.I'm at https://tomscott.comon Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscotton Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscottand on Instagram as tomscottgo"

Today I am doing a 24 hour challenge AGAIN. BUT, this time, I wanted to make it a little more interesting. I am not too big on challenges on my channel, just because I can't compete with the extreme challenges that so many other youtubers are willing to do LOL. I just like painting on things üòÇ PLUS, I feel like a lot of challenges these days have gotten really pointless. But, this one is good haha. I decided to try  to paint and decorate different things for 24 hours. I have a lot of art supplies laying around my art room, just begging to be painted. But I don't often have the time to paint that much at a time. So this was a great opportunity to put a bunch of it to good use finally.I am going to be painting on a seashell, painting a pencil pouch, painting a rock, painting a squishy (mini squishy makeover lol), making a custom mug, decorating a giant clothes pin and a surprise weird item LOL.

Just about everyone knows of the Mazda Miata and the RX-7, but what about the tiny car Mazda made that has a huge following in the car community? Japan has variable taxes on vehicles based on their displacement, hence why manufacturers started making tiny cars called Kei cars.

The Autozam has super car features like the super rad gull-wing doors and even more interesting is the story of how the autozam came to be.

This test, which does not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, is intended to demonstrate Crew Dragon‚Äôs ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. The six-hour test window opens at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC. A backup opportunity with the same six-hour launch window opening at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC, is available on Monday, January 20. Current weather data suggests our best opportunity for the launch escape test will be towards the end of the four-hour window, but we will continue to provide updates as new data becomes available."
