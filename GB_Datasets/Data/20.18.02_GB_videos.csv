Footage was really quite difficult to find, so hopefully you can forgive me playing a little visually loose with the truth.Also the Soviet space program was barely even mentioned in the video. I‚Äôve often thought it‚Äôs a bit sad that the Soviet Union got the first satellite into space, the first doggos (let‚Äôs not discuss it), the first man, the first woman, the first probe to the moon, the first spacewalk, and the first robot on another celestial body ‚Äì yet the winner‚Äôs medal generally goes to the US for reaching the moon, and doing it so brilliantly. (Which they did, and which it was.)Not in any way meaning to discredit the US here, I‚Äôd just like to urge you to spare a thought for those other clever men and women a continent away who were ‚Äì at the very same time ‚Äì also taking marvellous and brave strides into space. I‚Äôve had quite a fascination with the Apollo program over the years, and space in general. If it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre interested in too, here‚Äôs the stuff I really, really enjoyed reading and watching. (No one‚Äôs paying me for this, I just dig them. The audiobook versions are great too.)Mike Massimino - Spacemanhttps://www.amazon.com/Spaceman-Astronauts-Unlikely-Journey-Universe-ebook/dp/B01A4B1SK0Robert Kurson - Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man's First Journey to the Moonhttps://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Men-Odyssey-Astronauts-Journey/dp/B075H2P225/ref=sr_1_2keywords=apollo+8&qid=1581704489&s=digital-text&sr=1-2Andrew Smith - Moondust: In Search of the Men Who Fell to Earthhttps://www.amazon.com/Moondust-Search-Men-Fell-Earth/dp/0007155425Apollo 11 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8760684/In the Shadow of the Moon (THE DOCUMENTARY, NOT THE OTHER ONE) https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0925248/Before uploading this video I had a fairly long conversation with a meme-knowledgeable friend about whether dabbing would be appropriate in a thumbnail.

I love hunting through thrift stores to find old, rejected items and then decorating them and putting my own style on them to turn them into new pieces of art. Today I decided to use an antique clutch (satchel lol) and I decorated it using leather paints. I hope you like bright, colorful designs, and butterflies! Also, bringing back the fruit theme so get ready for that.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

A few months ago, I found out that Amazon started offering a personal shopping service. That's right, Amazon was styling people for a small fee each month - so I figured, we had to try it out to see what kind of clothing & accessories they would send me, and if they would be any good. So we took a quiz and good ole' Bezos sent me a sack of clothes. What do you guys think of my Amazon personal shopper haul? EDIT (for clarity) - although I eliminated most color options in the quiz, I did leave on every pattern except animal print, I said that I often wear edgy styles and I also liked boho styles, said that I would try pretty much every trend except for animal print and cropped pants, and clicked yes on multiple silhouettes and clothing items - so they had plenty of optionality! just in case you guys missed some answers!This video is NOT sponsored!You can check out our Colourpop frankenlipsticks here! https://colourpop.com/collections/safiya-nygaard-makeupSafiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/Check out our merch here: https://fiendsbysaf.com/If your size is sold out, sign up for email updates!MUSICVia AudioNetworkAssistant EditorsEmily Linden & Josie Latino"

Censors have been erasing critical social media sites. At least two outspoken citizen journalists have disappeared. Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin are among those whose whereabouts are unknown. And citizens were outraged at the death of Wuhan Doctor Li Wenliang, who raised the alarm about the virus. Meanwhile, China has reported 97 more deaths from the Corona virus and more than two thousand new infections, claiming these are the lowest figures since January. Officials also predict the epidemic could be over by April. But the World Health Organization disagrees, arguing it's too early to say whether infections have peaked. They're warning the outbreak poses a global threat potentially worse than terrorism. And people in and outside of China are beginning to question the accuracy of the information they are getting.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dw_stories/F√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#Coronavirus #ChenQiushi #DWNews"

They‚Äôre all important parts of the tale of the axion - a tale whose end may take us beyond the standard model and solve one of the most vexing mysteries in astrophysics. Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'Dowd & Graeme GosselGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealPost Production: Yago Ballarini, Max Willians, Pedro OsinskiDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberThe story of the axion is a classic physics tale: intrepid scientists delve deep into trackless mathematics in search of answers to a mystery. And there, against all expectations, they find the hint of a completely new and unexpected denizen of the natural world. In this case the mystery was a subtle inconsistency in the behavior of the fundamental forces. And the unexpected discovery? A brand new particle - the axion - which, while not proven to exist, may explain a much more famous conundrum. The axion may explain dark matter.
