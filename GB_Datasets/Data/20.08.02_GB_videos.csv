Working in the shadow of an esteemed police veteran (Samuel L. Jackson), brash Detective Ezekiel “Zeke” Banks (Chris Rock) and his rookie partner (Max Minghella) take charge of a grisly investigation into murders that are eerily reminiscent of the city’s gruesome past.  Unwittingly entrapped in a deepening mystery, Zeke finds himself at the center of the killer’s morbid game.SPIRAL stars Chris Rock, Max Minghella, Marisol Nichols, and Samuel L. Jackson, and is produced by the original SAW team of Mark Burg and Oren Koules. The film is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Josh Stolberg & Pete Goldfinger."

It is possible to make different waves more than you can imagine if you challenge yourself with your passion(BURN), and go forward.On “THE BACK OF THE MOON”, which no one knows about, instead of a moon that does not shine on its own and always shows the same side, LOOΠΔ serves as a fuse in the heart of the whole LOOΠΔs around the world.Through this album, LOOΠΔ is about to show the whole different confident, challenging LOOΠΔ, not the same LOOΠΔ people all know.Intro ‘#’ gives a hint that whole different album is made in a different space, going over [X X]’s point.The titled song ‘So What’ is an impressive urban dance piece with a grand bass and signature Hornstab, which further maximizes the “girl crush” that LOOΠΔ has not shown before. With the message ‘Break the boundaries that the world has made’ and it added the depth in LOONAVERSE.‘Number 1’ is a 808-bass groove that adds a dreamy atmosphere EP sound with rich harmony and emotional voice, just enough to show another vibe of LOOΠΔ. ‘Oh (Yes I Am)’ is a song that has a clear sound and mysterious vibe that LOOΠΔ is looking for ‘Infinite possibilities that I have’. ‘Ding Ding Dong’ is a dance pop genre, that features a bass line built on top of a piano leap make LOOΠΔ’s voice more charming. On the lyrics, LOOΠΔ compared ‘Ding Ding Dong’ a sound that it rings through the heart, with an expectation of the one approaching first, with timid characteristic.The lead single ‘365’ is a lyrical R&B ballad, based on the piano, with a message that LOOΠΔ will always shine Orbits around the world, who has been waiting for LOOΠΔ for a long time with moon’s heart.Also, LOOΠΔ’s [#] limited version has CD only songs that will add extra fun.LOOΠΔ discovered destiny in coincidence and fate.#이달의소녀 #LOONA #SoWhat #MV #BlockBerry #BlockBerryCreativeMore about LOOΠΔ/Apple Music : https://music.apple.com/us/album/ep/1497089137?l=ko&ls=1&app=itunesSpotify : https://open.spotify.com/album/6rOL2mghTfDyx5CY0eU1Dn?si=t69PNruEQym2POVzTaW26QAmazon Music: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084HCZLV9/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_awdb_t1_x_UWipEb665S311LOOΠΔ Official : http://www.loonatheworld.comLOOΠΔ Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Twitter : https://twitter.com/loonatheworldLOOΠΔ Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Official Korean Fan Cafe : http://cafe.daum.net/loonatheworldCopyrights 2020 ⓒ BlockBerryCreative.

See something in this story you want to try for yourself? Here are a few tips to get you started. First you’ll need the Google Assistant. If you don’t already have it, you can learn more at https://assistant.google.com00:12 “Show me photos of me and Loretta” To use the Assistant to pull up photos, make sure you and your favorite people are tagged in your Google Photos. Then just say, “Hey Google, show me photos of me and [their name]” 00:21 “Remember, Loretta hated my mustache.”To try this one, just say, “Hey Google, remember…” and then whatever you’d like the Assistant to help you recall later. Like “Hey Google, remember Dad’s shoe size is 8 and half” or “remember Maria loves lilies.”  Then, to see everything you’ve asked the Assistant to remember, just say, “Hey Google, what did I tell you to remember?”00:39 “Show me photos from our anniversary”To see photos from a wedding, anniversary, birthday, or graduation, you’ll need a Google Photos account, and you’ll also need to tell your Assistant the specific date. Just say something like, “Hey Google, remember my anniversary is May 18th” or “remember Mark’s birthday is March 30th.” Then you can use that information in many ways, like “Hey Google, show me photos from our anniversary” or “Hey Google, remind me to buy flowers on Mark’s birthday.”00:51 “Play our favorite movie.”First, tell your Google Assistant what your favorite movie is by saying, “Hey Google, our favorite movie is Casablanca.” Once you’ve purchased your favorite movie on Google Play Movies or YouTube, all you have to say is, “Hey Google, play our favorite movie” and the movie will start playing.C R E D I T S Voiced by Grandpop Music: Say Something (instrumental) - A Great Big WorldFilm clip: Casablanca.

Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend, Samantha VincentNo matter how fast you are, no one outruns their past. Summer 2020 is the time for F9, the ninth chapter in the saga that has endured for almost two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they’ve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, next year’s The Suicide Squad). F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe—from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tblisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom’s past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent."
