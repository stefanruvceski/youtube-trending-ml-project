When i watched the credits it showed that was written by a female writer. \n    So with all this talk of female empowerment by Kathleen Kennedy throughout this sequel trilogy, all her banging on about how she wants and aims to even out the numbers of male to female Star Wars fans, shes still hired male directors and writers for EVER ONE of the Disney Star Wars movies so far, so Mrs Kennedy is a \"hypocrite.\"", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T14:43:07.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-30T14:43:07.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/WMQoWQkz_DVZoy6bk9jBGbMjWsc\"", "id": "Ugyx4_mkfepQMBALcU54AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/aAFwMUFprz7KVASHuav0Qo20ui0\"", "id": "Ugyx4_mkfepQMBALcU54AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Captain69", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_mEfppnYt1jN0sKnsGKrxJ_6b5dbLwhjqEYQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCawdYnDAp4URWbDa9fkpG_A", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCawdYnDAp4URWbDa9fkpG_A"}, "videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "textDisplay": "86 on rotten tomatoes this movie is good", "textOriginal": "86 on rotten tomatoes this movie is good", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T14:34:36.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-30T14:34:36.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/218nwQaYrOqM3QspwsLZ4sR6vD8\"", "id": "Ugwgxk-eeMdh9pWKIh14AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/n4ZsHqyw3wBD6LPjo_N4trHZ_X0\"", "id": "Ugwgxk-eeMdh9pWKIh14AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "J Beck Electrical", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-D2ESBnoCESys6fPY-wZZmNh0cIfmt8xFA5w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkezXm0I_KhjLH_DnLXFN5A", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkezXm0I_KhjLH_DnLXFN5A"}, "videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "textDisplay": "Lucas: Writes a film and then splits it into 3 and then 6 movies. <br />Disney: Buys a work of art and then let&#39;s children draw all over it.", "textOriginal": "Lucas: Writes a film and then splits it into 3 and then 6 movies. \nDisney: Buys a work of art and then let's children draw all over it.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T14:33:48.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-30T14:33:48.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/yIYWsnDDVuisEZeE-vzl7gp2-8Y\"", "id": "Ugw3Si9ks-8pGU-0nWh4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/WPGhd7N32XlzAuzh2ieB9POLbFE\"", "id": "Ugw3Si9ks-8pGU-0nWh4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Gingercat 59", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78QJ0E9R3MjioSjZ6miQmLiXVjbUK_zjtwU3A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JMAqnywfeJenVyfv7qApg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1JMAqnywfeJenVyfv7qApg"}, "videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "textDisplay": "Great review mate, I&#39;m just about to post mine", "textOriginal": "Great review mate, I'm just about to post mine", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T14:27:37.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-30T14:27:37.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/UhpSJRENZhZ-4jcKPGOeqka-xYo\"", "id": "UgyQPSK9qsT1Rs7xQgp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/WIX8yqxr1PBfFZTgfHeH8HLdGgA\"", "id": "UgyQPSK9qsT1Rs7xQgp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Bram V", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78mfiNCbZzDj3_KxYc2uF0Pk5cEk4hGhhtxDw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1klQzqv-xQBb0yOrAviAwA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1klQzqv-xQBb0yOrAviAwA"}, "videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "textDisplay": "I get what you mean with not talking about it anymore.

Snoke is not as important to this story as Palpatine was to the OT and PT, cuz Ben's gonna kill him and we don't find out who Snoke was and why he was so important.\"  Fans HATED that, complaining that Johnson character-assassinated Luke, made Rey into a Mary Sue that doesn't make any sense and turned Snoke into a completely irrelevant character.\n\nSo, once Trevorrow was out of the picture whatever mess he was going to make - and trust me; if you saw Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, there was no way his version of Ep 9 wasn't going to be terrible - and Kathleen Kennedy got Abrams to come back, he's painted into a creative corner.  \"Well, shit!  I did this thing and fans complained; Johnson changed everything and the fans hated that even more.  Now what do we do?\"\n\nSo, we got a film made up of several admittedly cool-looking sequences stitched together with the barest minimum of a plot and sloppily constructed answers to the biggest nitpicks (\"Rey's a Palpatine; that's why she's so powerful!\", \"Snoke was created by Palpatine; that's why he didn't matter as much!\", \"Luke backtracks on his behavior at he beginning of TLJ\") and packed with \"memberberries\" including Palpatine, Lando, a Luke Force-ghost appearance, the Yavin medal (and Chewie finally getting one), Sith mythology, old-style Star Destroyers with Death-Star-like superlasers, and the voices of Anakin, Obi-Wan, Ahsoka, Qui-Gon, Yoda, Mace Windu, etc.  Abrams and Terrio pandered to the nostalgia-obsessed portion of the fanbase - the ones who thought the only good thing about Rogue One was the Darth Vader scene -  and said, \"There, do you love us now?\"\n\nOops...guess not, cuz now the fanbase is more polluted and toxic than ever with even more whiny, spittle-flecked rage...and the best thing about it?  It's partly their fault.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T05:12:37.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-30T05:12:37.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/lJUw_li9ShnSy9Ki6I2TOlBct6g\"", "id": "UgyOquCjFQ-2v665tUZ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/fOyK4d3aHrQrYAeAuM6xK85a5hI\"", "id": "UgyOquCjFQ-2v665tUZ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "karhart", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79SEmFmW72aYxXZO5R0SRG0qb-aU0C9g9rAFA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQdPfKgi-aNGL8LPBSkBNA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuQdPfKgi-aNGL8LPBSkBNA"}, "videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "textDisplay": "I didn&#39;t love it, but I was okay with it.

Then this trilogy could have been so much better.   That\u2019s why your friend doesn\u2019t like it.  \nBasically anything they do after episode 6 invalidates all prequels.
