I answered tired and confused sense we stayed up til about 4-5 AM, and even though he is always calm and always has a calm voice, I could hear the panic in his voice.

I need to talk to your dad, its important!&quot; And I was like &quot;I&#39;m not home, but my dads probably asleep and definitely isn&#39;t going to answer his phone. The best I can tell you is to call my mom and get my dad, here&#39;s her number.&quot; And we basically hung up after that. A bit concerned, but I was tired and fell back asleep. My mom picked me up about 4, and I asked what had happened (I had almost completely forgot). She said my aunt had been punched and was in the ICU. I called my cousin Hannah, and explained what had happened. She asked her dad and her dad was like yea, she was hurt, she&#39;s in the ICU, but he didn&#39;t want to tell her just yet.  The hospital said she was brain dead, and thinking about pulling the plug. I had no reaction. I walked upstairs then came back down another half hour later and was like &quot;did they make a decision? Did they do it?&quot; And my mom was like &quot;they probably already did.&quot; I didn&#39;t realize what had happened until that night. Started crying at 10, and couldn&#39;t calm down til 3 AM. It hit 4 am when i had fallen back asleep. I had school the next day, but didn&#39;t go. I felt so shitty because I felt like my reaction wasn&#39;t enough. Like I didn&#39;t care, like I never loved her. But I did. I still do. (For anyone curious, someone was groping her breasts, and the bartender kicked him out.
