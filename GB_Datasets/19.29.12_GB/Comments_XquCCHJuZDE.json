Many great moments, such as Luke&#39;s last stand, Yoda&#39;s return, and Luke&#39;s death in front of the twin suns was really moving...<br /><br />So im positive on Ep VII and VIII...but this movie sucks sweaty gun gun balls...<br /><br />Im not mad at Ep 9...im just disappointed...<br /><br />This movie felt so weird to watch, it felt like i missed a film in between Last Jedi and this one, things just happen for the sake of it...nothing felt like it was set up and nothing gets explained.\u00a0<br /><br />The opening is SO RUSHED and was a giant cluster f*ck, how did Kylo find out that Palpatine was alive?!

This is what I mean by i felt like there was a film missing in between this one and the last one, it&#39;s like the set up was done off screen and they skip straight to the &#39;pay off&#39; . It felt like the movie started in the middle of another one that was supposed to exsist in between this and TLJ...it&#39;s so bizarre...<br /><br />Also they don&#39;t even bother explaining Palpatine&#39;s presence in a convincing way...could u imagine the people who went into this movie completely blind without watching any trailers and don&#39;t even know that Palpatine is in it, could u imagine how baffled they would be when they see that Palpatine just appears at the very start with little to no realistic or convincing explanation, it would be the most confusing sh*t ever, and what makes it worse is that Palpatine&#39;s appearance feels completely pointless and a desperate attempt to get people who didn&#39;t like TLJ somewhat interested again...<br /><br />This movie is just complete nonsense...it seriously felt like a continuation of a movie that never exsisted, it&#39;s so f*cking weird...and just feels completely disjointed from the last 2 films.<br /><br />The plot twist of Rey being the grand daughter of Palpatine is laughbly bad... like WTF! I mean sure it was unexpected...but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good...it&#39;s probably one of the\u00a0WORST\u00a0plot twists i&#39;ve seen in a film...PERIOD...and makes her arc and development from the last movie completely pointless and just completely ruins what made me like about her character in the last film. Basically:<br /><br />Rian Johnson:\u00a0Anybody can be a hero...u don&#39;t have to be from a special bloodline to be someone special or someone of importance...u can build and create yr own legacy...who yr related to doesn&#39;t matter...it&#39;s who u choose to be that matters...<br /><br />JJ Abrams:\u00a0NOOOOOO! U MUST BE RELATED TO SOMEONE IMPORTANT...OTHERWISE U WILL NEVER BE IMPORTANT!<br /><br />Like wtf man...<br /><br />It makes TLJ feel completely pointless and just bashes that film, the film with actual interesting ideas and story, while this film feels like fan fiction created by someone on Reddit...how was this approved to be released?! It&#39;s bashing of the last film isn&#39;t subtle, it completely retconnes or goes against what Rian did in his film, Rey comes from a family of nobody&#39;s, nah she&#39;s actually a descendant of Palpatine. Luke catching the lightsaber and saying &#39;A jedi&#39;s weapon deserves more respect&#39; felt like it was mocking Luke&#39;s characterization in TLJ......lightsabers aren&#39;t what make a jedi special, it&#39;s they&#39;re knowledge and wisdom of THE FORCE that does...a lightsaber is just a weapon they use...it&#39;s not the core of what makes a great jedi...Luke&#39;s knowledge of the force is what gave him the victory against Kylo in the last jedi not a lightsaber...in this he acts like the lightsaber is what makes the jedi...it&#39;s so frustrating. Snoke simply being used to progress and push Rey&#39;s and Kylo&#39;s story foward...nah...he was just Palpatine&#39;s puppet all along...because idk f*ck it why not, just put a bunch of meaningless twists that mean nothing...and just completely rush the story...this movie literally goes against everything i liked about TLJ, a movie that doesn&#39;t rely on nostalgia, a film that challenges it&#39;s audience rather than cater to them, and has actual themes in it&#39;s story, it&#39;s a movie that has something to say...this is the opposite...<br /><br />Kylo&#39;s death felt so sudden and out of nowhere...and u do it right after Rey kisses him...because that ain&#39;t so cliche, i was actually for Kylo and Rey having romance or &#39;Reylo&#39; as many fans call it...a hero and villian having romantic feelings towards each other would&#39;ve been an interesting story...but it was done in the worst way possible and was really rushed...<br /><br />Now i will admit there were some good moments in this mess of a movie, like Alex said seeing Chewbacca&#39;s reaction to Leia&#39;s death was heartbreaking. C3-PO was actually really entertaining in this, id say it&#39;s probably the character at it&#39;s best in this film. The confrontations between Kylo Ren and Rey were pretty good and by far the best and entertaining parts of the film...(except for the one where Rey is revealed to be a Palpatine). Luke and Leia finally being together again at the end was a nice and heart warming moment...this movie definitely has it&#39;s moments...but overall i think this is a really BAD and disappointing conclusion to this series...but atleast it ain&#39;t as bad as the final season of Game of Thrones...\ud83d\ude05<br /><br />I know alot of fans blame TLJ for how this film turned out...and they say how Rian left JJ with nothing to go on...but i disagree...there were many things Abrams could&#39;ve expanded upon from Rian&#39;s ideas...i&#39;ll even list things he could&#39;ve done...<br /><br />- At the end of TLJ, Kylo Ren is an unstable and emotionally confused boy in charge of an entire army, thats an interesting story right there, that u could&#39;ve expanded upon, u could&#39;ve also expanded upon the conflict between Hux and Kylo...like near the end of TLJ Hux was gonna kill Kylo while he was knocked out, and since Kylo started kicking the sh*t out of him, there is a story there. What if Hux and Kylo are constantly at each others throats, what if First Order soldiers lost faith in they&#39;re leaders and the army just crumbles due to poor leadership.<br /><br />- Rian re-united the whole group at the end, Rey was back with Finn and met Poe for the first time, this film could&#39;ve had Rey, Poe, and Finn build a friendship as a group ON SCREEN, instead of off screen like they did here, i like those characters individually but as a group they&#39;re really weak.\u00a0<br /><br />- Rey and Kylo connections could be continued and play a more major part of the story, there wasn&#39;t really much of it in this film...and thats what i was most excited to see...it was one of the best parts of the last film...and they don&#39;t really do much with it...except for one admittedly cool fight scene...<br /><br />- You could&#39;ve actually built up a romantic connection between Rey and kylo instead of forcing in a kiss before Kylo dies...it was so rushed in this film...<br /><br />- Luke could&#39;ve had a bigger affect on the plot, he could&#39;ve taught Rey multiple lessons as the films goes on, instead of having one moment that mocks the last film without any subtlety and one fan servicey moment, because Luke doesn&#39;t really teach Rey that much in the film before this, so it would&#39;ve been cool to see Luke continue Rey&#39;s training from the last film...instead of having Leia teach her off screen...<br /><br />There are other directions u could&#39;ve taken this in...directions better than this atleast...<br /><br />This movie ain&#39;t in my headcanon, to me TLJ is the last film, Luke inspiring hope across the galaxy with his last stand is a better ending to the series than this...Luke dies in TLJ and thats where the Skywalker saga ends for me...Luke&#39;s story ends in that film which means the saga ends with that film...<br /><br />I honestly wish Rian Johnson directed the whole trilogy...i was\u00a0WAAYYY MORE\u00a0interested in the story he wanted tell than JJ&#39;s...sorry JJ ain&#39;t hatin on ya but thats how i feel...<br /><br />My ranking of all the films:<br /><br />1 - Empire strikes back - 10/10<br /><br />2 - A New Hope - 10/10<br /><br />3 - Last Jedi - 8/10 <b>(DON&#39;T  F*CKING @ME)</b><br /><br />4 - Return of the jedi - 7/10<br /><br />5 - Force Awakens - 6/10<br /><br />6 - Solo - 6/10<br /><br />7 - Rogue One - 5/10<br /><br />8 - Rise of Skywalker - 4/10<br /><br />9 - Phantom Menace - 3/10<br /><br />10 - Revenge of the sith - 2/10<br /><br />11 - Attack of the clones - 1/10<br /><br /><b>Sorry prequel fans</b>", "textOriginal": "I thought Force Awakens was an okay movie, it was fun and entertaining, nothing special but an enjoyable experience...\n\nMany will disagree...but I think Last Jedi is great, i like everything they done with Luke.

directions u could've taken this in...directions better than this atleast...\n\nThis movie ain't in my headcanon, to me TLJ is the last film, Luke inspiring hope across the galaxy with his last stand is a better ending to the series than this...Luke dies in TLJ and thats where the Skywalker saga ends for me...Luke's story ends in that film which means the saga ends with that film...\n\nI honestly

I think I ranked it my 5th favorite out of the 7 main films, but over time, I can&#39;t. It&#39;s my favorite out of the ST, but that puts it at #7 for me. I only ever watched it once.

I&#39;ll say that you&#39;re right about it as a standalone. The main problem people have with the film is that it doesn&#39;t respect any of what came before it, and as a result forms many contradictions and retcons (such as how hyperspace travel works, or how the Force now just balances itself, etc.). If we don&#39;t take into account the fact that it&#39;s part of a series/universe that it has to respect, a lot (not all) of those issues disappear, and it can be seen as a more fun movie to people.

When you break it down, there&#39;s actually a lot in the movie that doesn&#39;t make sense or work at all.

If TLJ didn&#39;t have to adhere to the laws and such of the previous films/stories, I&#39;d put it in the same boat. It actually becomes a lot more fun of a movie to watch if you don&#39;t regard it as canon (since if you do, it breaks the SW universe anyway).<br /><br />Hell, I&#39;d even say it has some really good/interesting ideas (Rey and Kylo having a thing together, as a Jedi and Sith on opposite sides, or Luke falling from grace, etc.). It just didn&#39;t work at earning them and/or execute them very well. It had a lot of ideas that I&#39;d have been down for if they&#39;d been written and planned with more care. Luke could very well have had such a drastic change in character, but we&#39;d have to experience it. What we got was him suddenly having a complete 180 shift in character, without doing anything to earn it, and telling us &quot;This is how it is now. Done.&quot;.

I definitely wouldn&#39;t have felt the weight of validity of the change as much as with the way they showed it.<br /><br />But to be fair, it&#39;s not all Rian&#39;s fault. Every Star Wars movie to date has taken place with quite some time between each other (1 year at the shortest, or 3, or 10). JJ ended TFA on a serious cliffhanger that Rian was forced to start off with, meaning that literally no time was able to pass between movies and it basically turned it from its own part of the story to a direct continuation of the first part. Rian wasn&#39;t given any kind of time jump to change the scenery, stakes, or situation. It&#39;s really hard (or even impossible) to set up anything new in a sequel if it takes place right where the previous movie left off. But Rian tried to. Not to say that he didn&#39;t do it poorly on his own, but he was given a tough job to begin with. Then again, he could&#39;ve started the movie off with Rey meeting Luke, and <i>then</i> a time skip, but how would that work with the opening crawl?

Like I said before, it was trying to set up basically an entirely new story from scratch since Rian Johnson wrapped everything up with the last movie. That was definitely on him.
