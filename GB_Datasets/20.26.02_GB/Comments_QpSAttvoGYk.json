Already 27 and single. My friends and parents are pushing me to date, get a boyfriend and marry. Its frustrating and they make me look desperate that I need guy attention. I feel so much pressure and they dont listent when I say I'm not trying to find a boyfriend. And they say 'you're 27 you should already have kids right now.' 'Do you want to be an old maid?' I just want them to stop. \ud83d\ude22", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-25T14:07:05.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-25T14:07:05.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/dLKFXSvm779U3QDegn8oSOtZ00A\"", "id": "UgwiqKpIg83Pj9PF6154AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "QpSAttvoGYk", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/NDM_ho0ysIH0SfJDL5pc6a5fGv0\"", "id": "UgwiqKpIg83Pj9PF6154AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Charlotte Seal", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_64UY_u2cdDJLV1UooF4YUZf63Y67ynkLwhw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcRe5MJUJAQOexj3AGya72g", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCcRe5MJUJAQOexj3AGya72g"}, "videoId": "QpSAttvoGYk", "textDisplay": "Ashley needs to know that she\u2019s one of those amazing women that is changing things!", "textOriginal": "Ashley needs to know that she\u2019s one of those amazing women that is changing things!", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 3, "publishedAt": "2020-02-25T14:02:55.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-25T14:02:55.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/KKZjDn_318eAb5_AaOBrMhXJnI4\"", "id": "UgztZLc15DREPHhNf0h4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "QpSAttvoGYk", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/9R-u-S6XU3Jxhx91WoJLOmhhoYw\"", "id": "UgztZLc15DREPHhNf0h4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Edward Kalanui", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79iUwut9bYzRElHImpuEjEfLdGue5zSe4UkUg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsLeHWoNFRXWpHiwuVQzTzA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCsLeHWoNFRXWpHiwuVQzTzA"}, "videoId": "QpSAttvoGYk", "textDisplay": "Been for going on seven yrs.
