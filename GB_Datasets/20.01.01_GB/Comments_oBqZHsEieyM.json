We NEVER wanted bigger \"Death Stars\", Tie Fighters and Storm Troopers all over again! We NEVER wanted that to begin with in Episode 7 TFA. \n\n\n   We wanted them to take things in new directions, new, original ideas for villains and threats, new, original and very \"alien\" looking planets, new ideas for how force sensitives can evolve with the force, and even maybe a further exploration into this \"balance\" of the force (that many get confused over); and we simply expected that the main protagonist Rey would have something to do with that. \n\n\n     Im just sick of the way all this has gone, people have us hardcore fans wrong, yeh we have a few picky sorts out there who dont want a \"woman\" main character or any new ideas introduced. But most of us were fine with Rey when she was introduced in TFA we found her interesting, and we just expected they would take it all somewhere, e.g. like ideas that Snoke could be a ancient threat that originated from Outside the Galaxy, thats original, thats a new idea.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 3, "publishedAt": "2019-12-25T15:10:18.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-25T15:10:18.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/bjn9fnVAgJMWYg7o5HsH8Ag7C8Q\"", "id": "UgyyPkj-rFgpPeg5gAV4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "oBqZHsEieyM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/jzv1VtoNEpkxTF3IWxktMXpEvL4\"", "id": "UgyyPkj-rFgpPeg5gAV4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "shabs1", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78BdZePfpD2CfMkP1naFYWQ_fThivW4imRnVA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj9yqrVc7p7wHJaTpvc5vSg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCj9yqrVc7p7wHJaTpvc5vSg"}, "videoId": "oBqZHsEieyM", "textDisplay": "Even the positive reviews of TROS don&#39;t make it sound particularly good.", "textOriginal": "Even the positive reviews of TROS don't make it sound particularly good.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-25T13:49:45.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-25T13:49:45.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/MQ8Riazgq3M8QLRM46ykCDTEhNc\"", "id": "UgxcxMdSO3sED5L-B454AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "oBqZHsEieyM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/vc6TY2b-EdnlWMv72x_Q1Za4Qek\"", "id": "UgxcxMdSO3sED5L-B454AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "LeeMastr", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_TVxEapdXNdwZdRrt-E2OE_KGOCjgaRhaGIQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD82XKBpbxLNUDQxvI8V8QA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCD82XKBpbxLNUDQxvI8V8QA"}, "videoId": "oBqZHsEieyM", "textDisplay": "Casual viewer;
