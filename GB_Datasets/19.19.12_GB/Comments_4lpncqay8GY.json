The numbers who voted in the referendum was high compared with elections.   Since then commentators and politicians have sifted over the results and admitted much was a backlash to the voters feeling disenfranchiesed for years.  Due to how governments of both sides including the Lib/Con pack had ignored the North and other areas devistated by closing of mines and heavy industry under the Thatchers Conservative governments, to be ignored and left behind with high unemployment or lack of opportunities.   The feeling of being disenfranchised and your vote is being ignored is one of many reasons there is a fall in voting behaviour in elections.   Yet my point is neither Labour or Conservative parties have considered PR or raised it since as an option, in fact it&#39;s been ignored and brushed under the carpet.  So when I&#39;ve heard people on these sights say things like &quot; we will change politics&quot;, &quot; politics will nerver be the same&quot;, &quot;Politics  will be different from now on&quot;.  I have to ask where?   How?  Nothing has changed and sadly nothing will change.  The disenfranchised are still disenfranchised as recently as the recent election with their vote ignored, unless of course you voted for the winning party.   Britain is in desperate need for reform but the governments want to hold onto power and control, after all wasn&#39;t that one of the main arguments for Brexit (for Parliment i.e governments (read PM and ministers) to control the destiny of Britain not European Parliment).  So why would they want to share it through PR and why did these people think it would change with rhetoric like that!!!", "textOriginal": "My understanding of many Brits who voted in the 2016 Referendum was because they felt disenfranchised for years by all Political parties and this was their first opportunity to \"first time my vote counted, \" \"have my voice heared\", \"let them (government) know how I felt\", \"give the government a good kicking\" were often repeatedly said.   The numbers who voted in the referendum was high compared with elections.   Since then commentators and politicians have sifted over the results and admitted much was a backlash to the voters feeling disenfranchiesed for years.  Due to how governments of both sides including the Lib/Con pack had ignored the North and other areas devistated by closing of mines and heavy industry under the Thatchers Conservative governments, to be ignored and left behind with high unemployment or lack of opportunities.   The feeling of being disenfranchised and your vote is being ignored is one of many reasons there is a fall in voting behaviour in elections.   Yet my point is neither Labour or Conservative parties have considered PR or raised it since as an option, in fact it's been ignored and brushed under the carpet.  So when I've heard people on these sights say things like \" we will change politics\", \" politics will nerver be the same\", \"Politics  will be different from now on\".  I have to ask where?

You combine geographical neighbour constituencies into one voting block, for example 5 seats. These 5 constituencies would still return 5 MPs, but the combined electorate votes PR. So for every 20% (100%/5 seats) of the vote your party wins, you get one of those 5 seats. Any remaining seat(s) with no party or candidate having 20% of more of the vote simply goes to whoever has the most votes left. <br /><br /><br /><br />This system allows for local representation, independents can still stand and have a realistic chance of election and nothing changes in how people need to vote - they still put one X in one box. No need for a complex multi-voting system. It results in a much fairer result and far, far less &quot;ignored&quot; votes.<br /><br />The number of combined constituencies could depend on the geographical size - for instance, very large constituencies like those in the Scottish Highlands could remain as they are, or maybe only combine 2 or 3 at most, to maintain the &quot;local&quot; representation and access to MP.<br /><br />Example of how this would work:<br /><br />The first 5 seats in SW England (as they are literally the edge of the country and easier to group with less complications):<br />St Ives - Tory<br />Camborne &amp; Redruth - Tory<br />Truro &amp; Falmouth - Tory<br />St Austell &amp; Newquay - Tory<br />Cornwall North - Tory<br /><br /><br />Total Votes cast across all 5 seats:<br />Tory  = 141,310 = 52.6%<br />Labour = 63,556 = 23.7%<br />Lib Dem = 53,515 = 19.9%<br />Green = 5,636 = 2.1%<br />Other  = 4,393 = 1.6%<br />Total Votes = 268,410<br /><br />So under this new system, for every 20% you get one seat, so all those above 20% get the first seats:<br />Tory 2 (40%) seats, leaving (52.6 - 40) 12.6% remaining<br />Labour 1 seat, leaving (23.7 - 20) 3.7% remaining<br /><br />So 3 of 5 seats already won. Now no party has 20% left, so next 2 seats go to the highest remaining totals, which are:<br />Lib Dem (19.9%)<br />and Tory (12.6%)<br /><br />So the 5 seats would be:<br />Tory 3 (60% of seats from 52.5% of vote)<br />Labour 1 (20% of seats from 23.7% of vote)<br />Lib Dem 1 (20% of seats from 19.9% of vote)<br /><br />Tories still get a majority, but now other parties get their deserved representation too. Instead of having (100 - 52.6) 47.4% &quot;ignored&quot; votes, under this system its only (3.7 + 2.1 + 1.6) 7.4% &quot;ignored&quot;. This really would incentivise more voters to actually vote, as each vote has a far higher chance of actually counting, even in a very one-party place such as this. Would people change who they voted for under this system? A percentage would for sure, no question. But would they have to change the process of how to vote? No. Yet everyone gets a much fairer result and with local representation. Surely a win win for everyone - apart from the minority who play the system to gain power.......<br /><br />(Note: these seats were chosen for simplicities sake, choose any 5 seats in any area to see the same effect, including Labour or SNP heartlands)", "textOriginal": "Localised PR solves most of these issues, as I've been saying for years now.\n\nBut what is it?\n\n\nIts very simple. You combine geographical neighbour constituencies into one voting block, for example 5 seats. These 5 constituencies would still return 5 MPs, but the combined electorate votes PR. So for every 20% (100%/5 seats) of the vote your party wins, you get one of those 5 seats. Any remaining seat(s) with no party or candidate having 20% of more of the vote simply goes to whoever has the most votes left. \n\n\n\nThis system allows for local representation, independents can still stand and have a realistic chance of election and nothing changes in how people need to vote - they still put one X in one box. No need for a complex multi-voting system. It results in a much fairer result and far, far less \"ignored\" votes.\n\nThe number of combined constituencies could depend on the geographical size - for instance, very large constituencies like those in the Scottish Highlands could remain as they are, or maybe only combine 2 or 3 at most, to maintain the \"local\" representation and access to MP.\n\nExample of how this would work:\n\nThe first 5 seats in SW England (as they are literally the edge of the country and easier to group with less complications):\nSt Ives - Tory\nCamborne & Redruth - Tory\nTruro & Falmouth - Tory\nSt Austell & Newquay - Tory\nCornwall North - Tory\n\n\nTotal Votes cast across all 5 seats:\nTory  = 141,310 = 52.6%\nLabour = 63,556 = 23.7%\nLib Dem = 53,515 = 19.9%\nGreen = 5,636 = 2.1%\nOther  = 4,393 = 1.6%\nTotal Votes = 268,410\n\nSo under this new system, for every 20% you get one seat, so all those above 20% get the first seats:\nTory 2 (40%) seats, leaving (52.6 - 40) 12.6% remaining\nLabour 1 seat, leaving (23.7 - 20) 3.7% remaining\n\nSo 3 of 5 seats already won. Now no party has 20% left, so next 2 seats go to the highest remaining totals, which are:\nLib Dem (19.9%)\nand Tory (12.6%)\n\nSo the 5 seats would be:\nTory 3 (60% of seats from 52.5% of vote)\nLabour 1 (20% of seats from 23.7% of vote)\nLib Dem 1 (20% of seats from 19.9% of vote)\n\nTories still get a majority, but now other parties get their deserved representation too. Instead of having (100 - 52.6) 47.4% \"ignored\" votes, under this system its only (3.7 + 2.1 + 1.6) 7.4% \"ignored\". This really would incentivise more voters to actually vote, as each vote has a far higher chance of actually counting, even in a very one-party place such as this.
