From gameplay and pay2win algorithms modeled almost exactly like slot machines (I'll repeat this for emphasis: Plarium was acquired in 2017 by Aristocrat Leisure Limited: literally a gambling machine manufacturer that get the bulk of their revenue from half-demented retirees and gambling addicts pissing away pensions on rigged machines in dark corners of casinos), to entirely fake \"gameplay\" trailers which are being marketed largely at children, to the actual numbers ie. average spend per user and daily revenue from in game transactions being huge red flags about the nature of these games and how they operate. \n\nThe fallout of their demonstrably criminal misconduct is millions of people with severe addictions that have lead to tens of thousands of cases of financial hardship and they are subject to none of the regulations that gambling operators have to be compliant with despite the games being nothing more than rebranded slot machines with a powerful social hook.\n\nIn the same breath that you would espouse integrity and ethical business dealings as being tenets your company hold essential, you promote morally bankrupt developers of the equivalent of digital crack and you personally contribute to harm and issues with addiction for millions of often young or vulnerable users. \n\nIt's pretty disgusting that this continues to be a thing. I ask those of you reading this who are actually informed on this problem and know of what I speak, to thumb this up or copy paste it until there's some sort of explanation or Plarium is no longer used as a sponsor. It's something they should be doing an expos\u00e9 on - not taking cheques from to promote companies that exploit life-destroying addictions. \n\nSome links with info, some directly related and others highlighting some of the issues that are arising with these games and how they operate:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xkCSQGsW3n8\n\nhttps://m.plarium.com/en/arbitration-agreement/\n\nhttp://www.rovrallovr.net/index.html\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5387773/\n\nhttps://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.plarium.com\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/venturebeat.com/2017/12/04/how-aristocrats-990-million-big-fish-deal-will-shake-up-social-casino-games/amp/\n\nhttps://moneymag.com.au/aristocrat-gambling-gaming/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.citynews1130.com/2016/02/02/dark-side-smartphone-games/amp/\n\nhttps://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/11853/my-fianc%C3%A9e-is-addicted-to-a-free-to-play-pay-to-win-game\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/melmagazine.com/en-us/story/video-games-are-getting-kids-hooked-on-pay-to-win-mechanics/amp\n\nhttps://medium.com/@jakhallman/addiction-to-freemium-mobile-games-is-the-only-bit-thats-free-47c85bbec673\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/kotaku.com/meet-the-19-year-old-who-spent-over-10-000-on-microtra-1820854953/amp\n\nhttps://joyofandroid.com/mobile-gaming-addiction/\n\nhttps://www.psychguides.com/interact/the-psychology-of-freemium/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/freemium-model-is-brilliant-but-its-ruining-my-life-2014-11\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.addictions.com/blog/a-new-addiction-on-the-rise-mobile-game-addiction/amp/", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-30T22:43:45.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-30T22:43:45.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/5_ITpu6MBMF788xpxcSmqgGJQ7s\"", "id": "UgxUaBtM7z5SK7V4cjl4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "ZhGQ-AlEKsw", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/NMUwPK805PRm9GXdYKGBBHZWcAU\"", "id": "UgxUaBtM7z5SK7V4cjl4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Adie K", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l791TVccZZ93UubNsIyndUFVb5S7JpU3gEFdSg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCctysVY-AvnZN-ZyLHIrwGQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCctysVY-AvnZN-ZyLHIrwGQ"}, "videoId": "ZhGQ-AlEKsw", "textDisplay": "Raid shadow legends = automatic dislike", "textOriginal": "Raid shadow legends = automatic dislike", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2020-01-30T22:38:46.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-30T22:38:46.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/eU11r1KKkRHp7Y7Za2-n7ZfBqcI\"", "id": "UgzCA0ubR5xIluF_-dx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "ZhGQ-AlEKsw", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/7f1KX2-HZxsDnmlC1Q36olG5y8A\"", "id": "UgzCA0ubR5xIluF_-dx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Marcus Antonius", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_Fbp58WZGQd-WLwq1Wm3uyEl1A1Kxeo9PpJw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh0wX7DFYCIBynRpbSlk1Jg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCh0wX7DFYCIBynRpbSlk1Jg"}, "videoId": "ZhGQ-AlEKsw", "textDisplay": "Raid: Shadow Legends is garbage, find a better sponsor ffs", "textOriginal": "Raid: Shadow Legends is garbage, find a better sponsor ffs", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2020-01-30T22:35:18.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-30T22:35:18.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/SXsyNlW_qujxXUDcm4TJdIV9K7A\"", "id": "UgyM667_Px0p05W86yJ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "ZhGQ-AlEKsw", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/3PmRnW9vPukqcNwSXoVa4nPjbic\"", "id": "UgyM667_Px0p05W86yJ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "TatsCatsandBats", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_nZdRzrD-ClPZkNPYAQb9TQeYkfCzEibJ3Lw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9_2XnIUbNIgYbDEF2ed0w", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCu9_2XnIUbNIgYbDEF2ed0w"}, "videoId": "ZhGQ-AlEKsw", "textDisplay": "Nikki should sue for damages.
