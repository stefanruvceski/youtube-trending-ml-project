There has not been an instance where they have not been honest or involved their following/fans/subscribers. Even giving an option to pay what you want for their hard work and not having a fixed price on it shows that they truly care. It\u2019s easy for people to sit on their couches, switch on Kara and Nate\u2019s videos and call it a day but putting out that content and editing whilst trying to enjoy the country their in, away from the comforts of your home, own space and surroundings is not easy. Honestly disappointing to see people hating on them despite them offering you to pay whatever amount you feel right or waiting for the video in February.

HAPPY TRAVELS", "textOriginal": "as a person who has had a youtube channel and was not very good at it , i hated the trolling comments and could not take them. you will have to have a very thick skin if you want to be youtuber ! My wife and i are very glad you guy's have done the right thing here. we do feel like you 2 are really nice people that are caring ,sharing, and love each other to the end. having said that we hope your channel continues to grow , but would like to see more of the local culture and people we have watched you guy's connect with over the years, and do feel like you went for a pay check on this 1. nothing wrong with making some money especially as much work as it takes to make these video's , but after looking through your Q2 report we feel you are making a lot of money from us watching your video's . so please get back to your root's and forgive me of my RANT yesterday and if asked we will forgive you guy's as well.
