I think in general, electronic voting is viewed as convenient and dependent on software. I view it more as, it should be hardware dependent. In hardware design, there is something called an antifuse. Basically, if you run a high enough current through an antifuse, the antifuse &quot;breaks&quot; and permanently forces a &quot;short circuit&quot; which is the opposite of a fuse(which is to permanently open the circuit). This tech is used to &quot;program&quot; FPGA gates very quickly. It could also be used for security purposes. The right hardware architecture would ensure that no tampering could be done, or at least, it would be very difficult. You wouldn&#39;t be able to change the outcome of the input. Theoretically, you could make a physical electronic device that is extremely tamper resistant that could even program itself so long as a voltage source and ground are provided. The weak link is reading the results from the device.

I think in general, electronic voting is viewed as convenient and dependent on software. I view it more as, it should be hardware dependent. In hardware design, there is something called an antifuse. Basically, if you run a high enough current through an antifuse, the antifuse \"breaks\" and permanently forces a \"short circuit\" which is the opposite of a fuse(which is to permanently open the circuit). This tech is used to \"program\" FPGA gates very quickly. It could also be used for security purposes.
