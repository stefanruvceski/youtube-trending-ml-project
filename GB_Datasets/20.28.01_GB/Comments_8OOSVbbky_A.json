I think mostly it was a knee-jerk reaction to something so sudden and unexpected from this couple to suddenly have such a long awaited video was suddenly restricted by a paywall, even if it was just a minimum of a dollar,  with no real warning this was happening, especially with the 100th county video attached to the end of the documentary it felt like a slap in the face and felt more like &quot;Hey thank you for watching us for several years and getting us to our 100th country, now give us money to see the video you have been waiting for for years.&quot;  I think what hit people most was all the build up to the 100th country with hyping it up having viewers vote on it and just dangling this big milestone under everyone&#39;s nose to just suddenly put a paywall in front of it(yes i know it would have been put on you tube for free later in the month but its still hurts a little to think that all of a sudden money was suddenly a factor when it hasn&#39;t been in the past) The cool think about Kara and Nate is they feel like real people who are not in it just for the money, and a paywall even as cheap as it was still hurt some because some creators who use paywalls tend to care just about the money. I think if they would have made this announcement earlier before posting it behind the paywall it might have gone over better had people known what was going to happen but the fact that this couple who has never asked anything of their content and have always made it accessible to everyone are suddenly asking you to pay for a milestone video everyone has been waiting for with no warning to people by surprise.  I am coming to this in the aftermath because i was not able to watch the first video or see the original comments when it came out so i had to catch up, but Nate nailed it with the apology even though i don&#39;t think it should have gotten that far and am disappointed that this project they worked so hard on is getting the credit it deserves taken away from it from the forced refunds.
