The numbers who voted in the referendum was high compared with elections.   Since then commentators and politicians have sifted over the results and admitted much was a backlash to the voters feeling disenfranchiesed for years.  Due to how governments of both sides including the Lib/Con pack had ignored the North and other areas devistated by closing of mines and heavy industry under the Thatchers Conservative governments, to be ignored and left behind with high unemployment or lack of opportunities.   The feeling of being disenfranchised and your vote is being ignored is one of many reasons there is a fall in voting behaviour in elections.   Yet my point is neither Labour or Conservative parties have considered PR or raised it since as an option, in fact it&#39;s been ignored and brushed under the carpet.  So when I&#39;ve heard people on these sights say things like &quot; we will change politics&quot;, &quot; politics will nerver be the same&quot;, &quot;Politics  will be different from now on&quot;.  I have to ask where?   How?  Nothing has changed and sadly nothing will change.  The disenfranchised are still disenfranchised as recently as the recent election with their vote ignored, unless of course you voted for the winning party.   Britain is in desperate need for reform but the governments want to hold onto power and control, after all wasn&#39;t that one of the main arguments for Brexit (for Parliment i.e governments (read PM and ministers) to control the destiny of Britain not European Parliment).  So why would they want to share it through PR and why did these people think it would change with rhetoric like that!!!", "textOriginal": "My understanding of many Brits who voted in the 2016 Referendum was because they felt disenfranchised for years by all Political parties and this was their first opportunity to \"first time my vote counted, \" \"have my voice heared\", \"let them (government) know how I felt\", \"give the government a good kicking\" were often repeatedly said.   The numbers who voted in the referendum was high compared with elections.   Since then commentators and politicians have sifted over the results and admitted much was a backlash to the voters feeling disenfranchiesed for years.  Due to how governments of both sides including the Lib/Con pack had ignored the North and other areas devistated by closing of mines and heavy industry under the Thatchers Conservative governments, to be ignored and left behind with high unemployment or lack of opportunities.   The feeling of being disenfranchised and your vote is being ignored is one of many reasons there is a fall in voting behaviour in elections.   Yet my point is neither Labour or Conservative parties have considered PR or raised it since as an option, in fact it's been ignored and brushed under the carpet.  So when I've heard people on these sights say things like \" we will change politics\", \" politics will nerver be the same\", \"Politics  will be different from now on\".  I have to ask where?
