I can sincerely say I had a lot of fun watching this movie.  There were many, many things that were ridiculous and ridiculously impossible and I feel that was what weakened it overall.  I personally like it better than Ep. 1,2, 7, and 8.   As a Star Wars fanatic, I will watch it over and over with enjoyment.  But, I will continue to regret that our favorite galaxy and its lure are under the tight control of the Disney movie machine (with the exception of productions such as yours) and deeper, more thoughtful storylines and concepts will often wither away on the cutting room floor replaced by things that are more profitable. <br /><br />I admit that I can&#39;t figure out the mindset of many fans and their sentiments pertaining to Episode 8 and connections between all the characters.  I really like the RJ Luke because of his humanity (Luke is probably my favorite character) and because I think his choices were made for compassionate and thoughtful reasons (I did not find him weak at all and clearly he got out of the funk and inspired Rey to keep going.)  RJ IMO smashed the otherwise repetitive stinker of a storyline that emerged from Ep.7 which was going nowhere new or interesting.  And it was Disney who determined that Luke had to die in Ep. 8 (I believe).  I don&#39;t see why Rey needed to be a Palpatine (he is clearly not a family man) and that connection didn&#39;t bring them any closer, but instead muddled things (Why the hell did they do that?!  I can&#39;t imagine any of his descendants being good people or otherwise remaining independent of his narcissistic controlling ways).  I&#39;m glad there was limited plot involving Palpatine because I feel he&#39;s been featured enough in other movies and I don&#39;t need more about him (however his final battle with Rey was lost in too brief fashion.).  I don&#39;t mind Rey calling herself a Skywalker since the name would otherwise not continue on and she was the raised by Skywalkers.<br /><br />Overall, I&#39;d say money has the largest influence on the fates of the Star Wars and its stories.  I think Ep.9 was scaled back and sped up to fit into the run time (How in the world could Anakin otherwise not show up at least somewhere?)

I can sincerely say I had a lot of fun watching this movie.  There were many, many things that were ridiculous and ridiculously impossible and I feel that was what weakened it overall.  I personally like it better than Ep. 1,2, 7, and 8.   As a Star Wars fanatic, I will watch it over and over with enjoyment.  But, I will continue to regret that our favorite galaxy and its lure are under the tight control of the Disney movie machine (with the exception of productions such as yours) and deeper, more thoughtful storylines and concepts will often wither away on the cutting room floor replaced by things that are more profitable. \n\nI admit that I can't figure out the mindset of many fans and their sentiments pertaining to Episode 8 and connections between all the characters.  I really like the RJ Luke because of his humanity (Luke is probably my favorite character) and because I think his choices were made for compassionate and thoughtful reasons (I did not find him weak at all and clearly he got out of the funk and inspired Rey to keep going.)  RJ IMO smashed the otherwise repetitive stinker of a storyline that emerged from Ep.7 which was going nowhere new or interesting.  And it was Disney who determined that Luke had to die in Ep. 8 (I believe).  I don't see why Rey needed to be a Palpatine (he is clearly not a family man) and that connection didn't bring them any closer, but instead muddled things (Why the hell did they do that?!  I can't imagine any of his descendants being good people or otherwise remaining independent of his narcissistic controlling ways).  I'm glad there was limited plot involving Palpatine because I feel he's been featured enough in other movies and I don't need more about him (however his final battle with Rey was lost in too brief fashion.).  I don't mind Rey calling herself a Skywalker since the name would otherwise not continue on and she was the raised by Skywalkers.\n\nOverall, I'd say money has the largest influence on the fates of the Star Wars and its stories.
