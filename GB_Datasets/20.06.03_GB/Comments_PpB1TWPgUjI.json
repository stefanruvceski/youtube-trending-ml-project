Your love isn\u2019t something to be ashamed of. When I see you and Ella, it gives me hope for my future. Hope that I will find a love as true and beautiful as yours someday. If I marry a woman, I\u2019m pretty sure my dad won\u2019t be there, either. It\u2019s a punch in the gut, it\u2019s something that will pull you apart, if you allow it to. Your community loves you. We cheer you on, we cry with you, we laugh with you. We may not be your dad, but we are here. Your feelings, your hurt, all of that is valid. Sending love. Sending strength. Praying for your father to have an open heart towards you and Ella.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-06T00:48:55.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-06T00:48:55.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/HAzJeBUW_X5XKjBsz33Yexrf4JQ\"", "id": "UgwYCURWgWYlP0qjxyh4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "PpB1TWPgUjI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/sBErjjLsbsoJYkN2F_R3iLAnwf0\"", "id": "UgwYCURWgWYlP0qjxyh4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "HowdyHowdy", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyN779cXLaHxP-P2VTdsbTF2hGhS9iZEmt1AQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPZioOtPyRd9dTYpSOemGsA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPZioOtPyRd9dTYpSOemGsA"}, "videoId": "PpB1TWPgUjI", "textDisplay": "\ud83d\udc9c", "textOriginal": "\ud83d\udc9c", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-06T00:47:23.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-06T00:47:23.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/UtOzEBXy1by6swbNOholqpJ17RE\"", "id": "UgyDUUqUMgj0mJt9ucp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "PpB1TWPgUjI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/0c0vwE4r8oTnzTOWwIwy0PpUlOQ\"", "id": "UgyDUUqUMgj0mJt9ucp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "lsp94", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxx9DcmEDZkDqCH0JWddDowFZi7PLnj9UdnSQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDydGW3esm4L4DtfnVqWhoQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDydGW3esm4L4DtfnVqWhoQ"}, "videoId": "PpB1TWPgUjI", "textDisplay": "I&#39;m watching the documentary now.
