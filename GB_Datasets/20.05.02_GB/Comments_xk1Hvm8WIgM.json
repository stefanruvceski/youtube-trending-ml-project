I don&#39;t boycott any specific publisher, so even though EA is shit, I&#39;m not gonna say that I&#39;ll boycott all their games. Because if they publish a good game, I will want to play it. Boycotting a specific game is a bit different, but generally if you&#39;re gonna do it, then do it. Don&#39;t say you&#39;re gonna boycott and then go play the game anyway. If I have no intention of playing a game, then it&#39;s not getting played. That god awful remake of DMC is my constant example. As a fan of the proper Devil May Cry series, I didn&#39;t like what I saw and heard about the remake, so to this day I&#39;ve never touched the game. My younger brother has it, he&#39;s played it, and doesn&#39;t have a problem with it. To quote &quot;It&#39;s a remake, it&#39;s not part of the rest of the series&#39; story. It&#39;s not that bad on it&#39;s own, and it&#39;s not a bad game, it&#39;s fine.&quot; While I do see the point of it&#39;s a remake it&#39;s not part of the series. That doesn&#39;t excuse it, these are established characters. Even if it&#39;s not the same story, the characters are special to people, it means something. Why the hell do you think people are pissed off about things like the live action adaptations of certain anime, like Death Note, Ghost in the Shell, or DragonBall Z. These things aren&#39;t completely disconnected, they have inherent meaning, to try and so drastically change that meaning (for the worse especially), is gonna cause a lot of people to be angry. And that&#39;s why despite my brother having the game, and me being able to play it, I won&#39;t touch it. Devil May Cry is a very important game series to me, I didn&#39;t entirely like the art and character style for 5, but that was entirely my own personal preferences. And the style it has isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s actually good, I just prefer the way some of the previous games looked, namely 3 and 4. As such, there&#39;s no reason for me to not play 5, it&#39;s great, and it&#39;s a great addition to the series, that&#39;s proper Devil May Cry.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve also considered playing Fallen Order due to how good it appears to be (I mean I technically have played it a bit, I played on my brother&#39;s account a bit), and that&#39;s published by EA. I will easily reward good games and behavior, that&#39;s what I think everyone should do. Reward games for doing a good job, not a crap job (looks at Anthem and Fallout 76, oh boy...), if you enjoy a game, even if it&#39;s bad, then that&#39;s fine. If something is objectively bad, but you still enjoy it, and want to support it, then that&#39;s your decision (though I&#39;d argue against supporting a bad game, which is why I&#39;ve not bought Fallout 76 or Anthem, played Anthem&#39;s beta, but didn&#39;t have money to buy it, so waited, saw a review and boy did I dodge a bullet, I initially gave benefit of the doubt to the beta because it was a beta, but the full release, no). So yeah, if you&#39;re gonna boycott something, boycott it, don&#39;t just say something and then do the opposite.
