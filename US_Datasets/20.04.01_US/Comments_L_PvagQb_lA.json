almost overshadowed \nAt the ending I feel kylo and Rey shouldve survived\nOr since both of them had their life force drained they both should\u2019ve died \nThat there is true balance to the force \nEither they both live or the both die \nYou can\u2019t have good without evil\nJust like you can\u2019t have evil without good\nYet this movie throws that out the window and is like fuck you\nThen again return of the Jedi did that too but it could\u2019ve been so much better\nAnd Anakin skywalker along with the other force ghosts should\u2019ve helped Rey defeat Palpatine in person\nAnakin should\u2019ve talked to Kylo and helped bring him back to the light with Han Solo \nThis whole movie is about the skywalkers and Anakin doesn\u2019t even fucking show up\nSure he says 1 line but that\u2019s it\nIt\u2019s annoying and I get why they did it \nIt\u2019s Disney and in their eye Anakin was the one who murdered a bunch of kids and they didn\u2019t want that face making a reappearance \nI say fuck you disney\nRegardless though with those flaws \nThe movie was still good \nIt kept me on the edge of my seat a few times and Palpatine\u2019s return was amazing \nBut it suffers from the things it suffered from in the last 2 movies", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-04T07:39:04.000Z", "updatedAt":

What? Where is the review. You are a critic right? Just say if it&#39;s good or bad. I for one on the other hand see this new trilogy as something not worth seeing. The argument for these 3 films can easily be summarized as bunch of people saying if only this an if only that. If only this director an if only that director. What&#39;s else could he have done. Let&#39;s not  forget the one that bring up the Star Wars expanded universe which mind you was discarded by Disney. So all the bickering amounts to is could of, should of,  and would of. Or excuses excuses, and excuses. It&#39;s simply a bad trilogy. There was no real long-term plan for it&#39;s direction from the get go. They rehash or sould I say repurposed the old to sell it as new. It gain an audience only because of nostalgia. It didn&#39;t earned it through Merit with proper storytelling and real character development. When you remove the nostalgia glass it easy to see all 3 films are all bad movies. It&#39;s corporate swill. it began as Kathleen Kennedy&#39;s girl powe fanfiction project. Rey Palpatine now Rey Skywalker is her self insert character. A perfect in every way idealized version of one&#39;s self inserted into someone else&#39;s intellectual property. A true Mary Sue in every way. So much so now her name is the new go to term for that kind of over powered perfect character. Let also remember the force is female. look it up I&#39;m not kidding. So after all this now it ends as corporate swill pandering woke Trash. Long ago back when people had common sense There once was a thing called target audience. This was what movie were mad with a certain group in mind. They tried to please the woke audience as well as the original fanbase. If you try to please everyone you in up pleasing no one. Disney had to learn the hard way. This is why a producer named Kamran Pasha chose to utilizes all three films into lesson plans. Teaching his class of students how not to write a script lol. Disney Star Wars lol. It not worth any emotional or Financial investment on behalf of the old fan base or casual audiences in general. I just stick to the original trilogy and call it a day. One more thing apparently Rey Skywalker is now the avatar the last air  bender. Because all the Jedi all live in her now. She started the story with nothing to lose. Then she finishes without earning nothing. Also no one&#39;s never really gone as the trailer so eloquently stated making everything every thing in the series pointless.", "textOriginal": "Ok. What? Where is the review. You are a critic right? Just say if it's good or bad. I for one on the other hand see this new trilogy as something not worth seeing. The argument for these 3 films can easily be summarized as bunch of people saying if only this an if only that. If only this director an if only that director. What's else could he have done. Let's not  forget the one that bring up the Star Wars expanded universe which mind you was discarded by Disney. So all the bickering amounts to is could of, should of,  and would of. Or excuses excuses, and excuses. It's simply a bad trilogy. There was no real long-term plan for it's direction from the get go. They rehash or sould I say repurposed the old to sell it as new. It gain an audience only because of nostalgia. It didn't earned it through Merit with proper storytelling and real character development. When you remove the nostalgia glass it easy to see all 3 films are all bad movies. It's corporate swill. it began as Kathleen Kennedy's girl powe fanfiction project. Rey Palpatine now Rey Skywalker is her self insert character. A perfect in every way idealized version of one's self inserted into someone else's intellectual property. A true Mary Sue in every way.
