For one patient whose dealing with chronic pain maybe 6 out of 10 level is moderate  because they are living  with pain every day last 3 or more years. But some patients 6 out of 10 level pain description may be excruciating! Therefore when it comes to pain LEVEL AND HOW IT FEELS DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR PATIENT SAYS !!! This is ridiculous if you ask me these 2 board certificate nurses making joke about patients pain level and assuming that they are faking or person who came to seek a medical attention because they think that something is wrong in their body is unprofessional and they need to get penalized for this actions!! When you are at dr office or hospital you are in your most weak moment and sharing so many personal information and that\u2019s why as a medical profession people has to have not just a degree you should have and known what respect and empathy! Both is equally bad but especially as a Maternity nurse and your pt getting ready to give birth already anxious, scared and IN PAIN somehow you are expert to say you are faking !", "canRate": true,
