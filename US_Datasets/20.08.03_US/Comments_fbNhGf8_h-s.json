It is recommended that all social activities be postponed at central epidemiological centers in all countries, as epidemics spread rapidly around the world and the spread of the virus in Korean churches has caused a high number of people infected with the virus. Countries should suspend closed space activities, and epidemic prevention operations are no exception. The government will receive the support and cooperation of the entire people and appreciate the hard work of medical personnel across the country.\n If the epidemic situation intensifies and worsens, it is recommended to deploy in advance, and local medical staff is advised to conduct on-site consultation and treatment to avoid consultation and treatment in narrow and confined places to reduce infection and casualties of medical personnel. Local township offices provide outdoor space for medical staff. Actively deployed to reduce medical casualties and maintain combat effectiveness. For severe and highly infectious cases, a mobile capsule negative pressure chamber tube bed can be provided, similar to the experimental diagnosis and treatment bed type of a childcare box, allowing individual treatment of severely diagnosed patients. The device is used for static sterilization, irradiation and sterilization of high temperature and ultraviolet catalysts, and the central government will study emergency treatment. When major infections occur in the community, people throughout the country should wear masks as much as possible to reduce outings and parties.\n In the future, the government is advised to study the vaccine as soon as possible, and to conduct the research before the first transmission of infectious diseases in the community. Preparations for universal virus inspections and rapid virus screening tests can quickly grasp the biggest weapon of the epidemic, and strengthen the protection and inspection of the entire population to ensure national health, the arrival of the government and our support.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-08T17:25:42.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-08T17:25:42.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/Tz2pR-PRF1sMmD9ndAvciDwRRPc\"", "id": "UgwjsEVXE2q6BQ-3c1V4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "fbNhGf8_h-s", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/yDnupFNcgWiYCIbz3qJjsZzXwn0\"", "id": "UgwjsEVXE2q6BQ-3c1V4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Spell Madam", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxKMeopVoOvrLytKrQ9JFVOt9jw1vDxgoXZGw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeTen_-eh3DVNtFX5j133Uw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeTen_-eh3DVNtFX5j133Uw"}, "videoId": "fbNhGf8_h-s", "textDisplay": "Why not let the passengers get of the ship in Mexico and then they can just simply come across the border.

president or a vice president to make these type of decisions the fact that the president and the vice president are not immediately getting these people off the Grand Princess and putting them into a

first place I also blame the cruise lines we cannot quarantine these people on board that ship uses recirculated air meaning it&#39;s going to spread like crazy the Diamond Princess already proved even if they shut the air system down there are still vents in every solitary cabin door and the cabins are not sealed meaning the virus can flow freely all throughout the ship all Ships should have a CT scanner on board so that you can determine if a person&#39;s lungs are filling up and for a multitude of other health problems the fact that we did not have already have a facility in place the fact that the hospitals do not have the proper supplies already in place the fact that the government is not helping our hospitals get these items in place is Ludacris we can spend billions and
