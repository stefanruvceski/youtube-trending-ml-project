But the thing is...I hadn\u2019t drunk the alcohol to even be hung over. I had a headache, I felt like I could develop a fever later during the day, I was tired, and I felt nauseous. I took some Advil and went in to work (stupid, I know, but this was before the pandemic started in the US. Because I didn\u2019t have a cough, I didn\u2019t suspect corona at all). Anyways, before lunch time that day, I had progressed to full on lethargy and fever. I felt so bad that I literally walked out of my job, got into my truck, drove to a parking lot, parked in the sun, and slept for three hours. I had chills, body aches, and high fever (102.5 F). I thought that maybe I had the flu? But the thing is: I didn\u2019t have a cough and I didn\u2019t sneeze. I did feel like I had shortness or breath, but I chalked that up to lethargy and exhaustion from the fever. The Advil didn\u2019t reduce my fever at all (it actually just upset my stomach more), but Tylenol did. I went to the clinic and got tested for flu and strep, both tests came back negative. I still didn\u2019t suspect corona. That night I went home and that\u2019s when the diarrhea began. I completely lost my appetite for a solid week. I ate only because I knew I had to eat. But I didn\u2019t want any food. Whenever I would eat it would make the diarrhea occur. I know this is TMI but the diarrhea wasn\u2019t like \u201cnormal\u201d diarrhea. It wasn\u2019t really watery and I didn\u2019t have persistent stomach cramps for a short period. No, this was intermittent cramping and pooping for DAYS. I never developed cold like symptoms what so I never ever suspected covid. So, the odd thing about the illness is that it was worse at night. I literally did not sleep for 3 nights out of the 8 days I was afflicted. During the day though, I would feel better. The sickness was the worst on day 1-2 and day 5-6. On day 5-6 the fever returned and I developed a pounding headache and neck stiffness to the point that I was concerned I had whatever that bacterial brain disease is called. The headache got so bad That I couldn\u2019t think straight. It was odd because I thought I was on the come up. The illness slowly fizzled out after day 6. From out of nowhere on days 6-12, I developed a deep, dry, barking cough (but not painful to the lungs at all). I figured My body beat the illness fully whenever the diarrhea stopped, I got my appetite back, and the fever and he ache were gone. In all the illness lasted 10 days. By day 12 I was fully recovered. I am a 30 year old male in the US. Also, my wife developed a cough worse than mine for all the days I was sick. Her voice got deep and she almost lost her voice at one point. We didn\u2019t relate her cough to my illness at all. After watching a lot of testimonials on YouTube, I suspect we had corona unknowingly. I think I had a GI version of the disease and I think my wife got a very mild case of the respiratory version. I\u2019m sorry if you think I shared too much, but I\u2019m just wanting to share my story in case any others come down with similar symptoms. Has anyone experienced what I have? If it was corona, I will say that I felt quite awful, but never like I was going to die. The most annoying thing was the GI part and lack of sleep. The scariest thing was the intense headache and high fever and freaking out that it could be meningitis. What I did to battle the illness was drink lots of electrolyte replenisher, take Tylenol, force myself to eat food, and sleep as much as possible. It was tricky because I thought I was better before I really was. Day 5-6 it came back hard with that headache and fever. I don\u2019t think it was food poisoning because of how long it lasted.
