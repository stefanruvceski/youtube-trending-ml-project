People won&#39;t get that. How about you just paint a cherry blossom tree by a lake but using these colors? But don&#39;t forget to use the colors in what I perceive as normal and natural combinations and contrasts so it&#39;s not too jarring for my Western eyes.&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s what happened here. They created a language, sounds, instruments, a whole new scale for their music - and then James Cameron was like &quot;that&#39;s too alien for my movie about aliens. I can&#39;t identify with these sounds. Make it sound more recognizable to my Western ears.&quot;.<br /><br />They delivered. They delivered so good. Too good. They delivered to a point where the music actually became alien to our ears. And James Cameron was afraid that people would not be able to identify with a music that they couldn&#39;t relate to anything they had heard before, so they forced them to ditch almost all of it and shove the rest of what they had created into a basic American-European shape of music.<br /><br />Imagine how pissed Americans or English people would be if I, as a German, just wrote a nonsense poem using English words in a way that made the patterns sound German to me with just the sounds being non-German because they are English.

People won't get that. How about you just paint a cherry blossom tree by a lake but using these colors? But don't forget to use the colors in what I perceive as normal and natural combinations and contrasts so it's not too jarring for my Western eyes.\"\n\nThat's what happened here. They created a language, sounds, instruments, a whole new scale for their music - and then James Cameron was like \"that's too alien for my movie about aliens. I can't identify with these sounds. Make it sound more recognizable to my Western ears.\".\n\nThey delivered. They delivered so good. Too good. They delivered to a point where the music actually became alien to our ears.
