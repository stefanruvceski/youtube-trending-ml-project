Emilio Flores/Getty Images\n\nBefore the sexual assault case, Bryant was sometimes in the shadow of Shaquille O\u2019Neal, playing Robin to Shaq\u2019s Batman. After Bryant adopted the Mamba persona, he emerged as his own man. He helped create the dissension that led Phil Jackson to retire and the Lakers to trade O\u2019Neal, though Jackson returned to coach Bryant and the Lakers again.\n\nBut years after saying \u201cI also want to make it clear that I do not question the motives of this young woman,\u201d Bryant seemingly did just that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo explain why he would not comment on the death of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager who was shot to death while returning home from a convenience store, he had a conversation with the journalist Jemele Hill. \u201cHe was speaking from the experience of someone who had been on trial for sexual assault,\u201d\u00a0she wrote in a column on Monday, \u201cand, in his mind, had been wrongfully accused.\u201d Bryant later apologized to Martin\u2019s family.\n\nAnd in 2018,\u00a0reflecting on the sponsors that cut ties with him\u00a0after he was arrested, including McDonald\u2019s and Coca-Cola, Bryant said they did so because he was too \u201cgritty.\u201d\n\nLater in his life, Bryant became a big supporter of women\u2019s athletics. He took his daughter Gianna to watch the Connecticut Huskies basketball team, recorded voice overs for the N.C.A.A. women\u2019s basketball tournament and talked constantly about the W.N.B.A.\n\n\n\n\nAnd at those 2018 Oscars? Hours after Frances McDormand, winner of the Best Actress award, gave a powerful speech about the need to include more women\u00a0in the film business, she was hobnobbing with Bryant at a post-show party.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-09T08:32:08.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-09T08:32:08.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/uCYxzRIOYle3-dmig9hLW9PUBM0\"", "id": "Ugxajwfz_qghBEHYtW94AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "67GIg3EMpEo", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/Fhq7ggCeVvmlMrOCIs1DBavDq4U\"", "id": "Ugxajwfz_qghBEHYtW94AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "loving densi", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78HBYrNTObbVZIq9G3GCnsAO8NSbq3EoW9tSA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd6GEGi1-Vz5WQBUDstBb9A", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCd6GEGi1-Vz5WQBUDstBb9A"}, "videoId": "67GIg3EMpEo", "textDisplay": "It\u2019s not about the clip for me, why did she even ask the question.
