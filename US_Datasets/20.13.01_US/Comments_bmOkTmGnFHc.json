I&#39;ve been crying off and on about this since Friday at lunch time when this appeared on my social media. I thought, or hoped this was just some cruel joke but no, it wasn&#39;t.

I will never forget the excitement my buddies and I were experiencing when all of 6 of us first saw them in concert for Moving Pictures. Ever since then we were all hooked, plain and simple!!! Even before that album, I heard Freewill and yes, I was a bit turned off by the singing (at first), but was hooked on this band and their music. Some guy told me, dude, that&#39;s Rush!!!!! You should listen to them!! I was like naaahh, and then my brother brough the cassette over and I listed to it and was blown away!!!!  I finally bought Permanent Waves and got into that record, I mean who wouldnt?? To this day, Natural Science is my absolute favorite song and to then I find out the drummer writes all their lyrics?!?!?!?! Wow!!! My childhood friends and I havent seen much of each other in recent years except for an occasional phone call but after I heard this news I managed to get a hold of one of them and told him he was my bro and that I loved him very much. Change is the only constant in the universe and events like this only remind us that nothing lasts forever and to cherish these moments in our life. This sad news really hit home unfortunately. All I can say is Thank God for Rush and these three individuals who helped shape some of my formative years and just helped put a smile on my face.

Neil was about 10 years older than me but the news of his death brought back a lot of memories one being spending many crazy days and crazy nights at Lakeside park in Port Dalhousie which is in the South end of St. Catharines. So sad man! No words but that you were a True Canadian icon and pioneer with which i had this small connection. Will miss you man.
