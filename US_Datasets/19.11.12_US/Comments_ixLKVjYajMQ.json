Because I could say, I &quot;think&quot; you robbed a bank and I &quot;heard&quot; someone confirm it, so I &quot;presumed&quot; you did it. And you would go to jail... Use your brain...

Oh I forgot, you are clueless on the English language... You don&#39;t understand what OPINION means...<br /><br />Not to mention I&#39;m tired of hearing the Russians will take over the Ukraine. The Russians could care less about the rest of the Ukraine... Otherwise when Obama sent them blankets they would have taken the whole country. Those sections ASKED for help, they are majority Russian speaking sections and the Ukrainian government passed a law for Russian to be the second language and they were tired of the rampant Ukrainian corruption.

Oh I forgot Hillary and Biden are above the law... But Trump isn&#39;t... And you say you are ex law enforcement... I would suggest you go back to law school and take a refresher course... But not from the 3 &quot;wizards&quot; that testified last week. And due to your thinking and English comprehension maybe we should revisit the cases you were involved in. <br /><br />And speaking of the wizards... Karlan... She has issues... Anyone who hates someone enough to cross the street instead of walking in front of A BUILDING owned by that person, has some serious mental issues...<br /><br />Plus if the President of the Ukraine couldn&#39;t say it was quid pro quo, due to repercussions of President Trump... That doesn&#39;t hold water... Because the President of the Ukraine, knows President Trump is being investigated... and can tell the truth without any repercussions.

Look at the top left hand corner of the Washington Post piece... \nIt says: \"The Post's View * Opinion\"\no\u00b7pin\u00b7ion\nnoun: opinion; plural noun: opinions\n\nA view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.\n\"I'm writing to voice my opinion on an issue of great importance\"\n\nSimilar words:\nbelief, judgment, thought(s), school of thought, thinking, way of thinking, mind, point of view, view, viewpoint, outlook, angle, slant, side, attitude, stance, perspective, position, standpoint, theory, tenet, conclusion, verdict, estimation, thesis, hypothesis, feeling, sentiment, impression, reflections, idea, notion, assumption, speculation, conception, conviction, contention, persuasion, creed, dogma\n\nThey need English professors not law professors to teach them reading and English comprehension.\nAnd actually a math, economics and history professors wouldn't hurt either...\n\nQuid pro quo, bribery, extortion, intimidation, abuse of power... \nWhat will the \"new spin word\" be this week? \nHe farted and it bounced off the wrong side of his ass?\nWe are impeaching him because he is getting things done and making us look bad?\nWe are impeaching him because he is unimpeachable??\nWhat is it going to be now?\n\nI think, I heard, I presume, isn't facts and evidence.\n\nNone will hold up In a court of law... Because I could say, I \"think\" you robbed a bank and I \"heard\" someone confirm it, so I \"presumed\" you did it. And you would go to jail... Use your brain... Also in an impeachment ALL three branches are supposed to be involved.\n\nWhy didn't Trump want to be involved? Because your team aren't following the rules... Read them... Oh I forgot, you are clueless on the English language... You don't understand what OPINION means...\n\nNot to mention I'm tired of hearing the Russians will take over the Ukraine. The Russians could care less about the rest of the Ukraine... Otherwise when Obama sent them blankets they would have taken the whole country. Those sections ASKED for help, they are majority Russian speaking sections and the Ukrainian government passed a law for Russian to be the second language and they were tired of the rampant Ukrainian corruption. And they had anti Ukrainian protesters there stirring up trouble, like we have CNN's heroes... ANTIFA here. And BLM which got started due to Obama jumping the shark on who was guilty.\n\nAnd the Russian hacking the server was a joke by President Trump, you twits... Because your darling little criminal Hillary had already deleted the 30,000 emails after being subpoenaed for them. Where was her obstruction of investigation or of Congress... Oh I forgot Hillary and Biden are above the law... But Trump isn't... And you say you are ex law enforcement... I would suggest you go back to law school and take a refresher course... But not from the 3 \"wizards\" that testified last week. And due to your thinking and English comprehension maybe we should revisit the cases you were involved in. \n\nAnd speaking of the wizards... Karlan... She has issues... Anyone who hates someone enough to cross the street instead of walking in front of A BUILDING owned by that person, has some serious mental issues...\n\nPlus if the President of the Ukraine couldn't say it was quid pro quo, due to repercussions of President Trump... That doesn't hold water... Because the President of the Ukraine, knows President Trump is being investigated... and can tell the truth without any repercussions. Because all eyes are on both countries.

I mean common sense dictates.<br /><br />then they say things like &quot;we have proof&quot; they don&#39;t. they have no fact witnesses about trump saying any kind of illegality.<br /><br />in a court of law, FACTS are all that matters. IF you were found standing next to a dead body, did you kill them? are you going to be thrown in jail instantly with no proof? there is no blood on your cloths, there is no weapon in your hands, the weapon they find does NOT have your fingerprints but someone else&#39;s. but according to democrats, that&#39;s all they need to get rid of you aka jail you aka impeach trump. how unfair would our court system be if they had hearsay. lets say someone saw the killer. that person tells 5 people who the killer is. the 5 people go to court and claim they were told by the person who SAW the murder, that, that specific person WAS the killer.... their testimony would be THROWN OUT. they are not DIRECT witnesses. however, those 5 would probably get grilled by lawyers to find out WHO the real witness is so they can have a DIRECT WITNESS TESTIFY....<br /><br />There are NO direct witnesses. everyone ASSUMES that trump was withholding aid based on quid pro quo blah blah blah. you know what they say about assumptions, they make an &quot;ass out of you and me&quot; (ass-u-me). and they think this will fly in a court of law to actually impeach trump? ridiculous.<br /><br />they try to argue about hearsay. one side says its hearsay the other side says its direct evidence. luckily, neither side will be part of the true process in the end. from what we&#39;ve seen, there is no direct evidence of trump saying anything out of line. even the transcript is squeaky clean. now you could say there is something WRONG with a squeaky clean call....but that again is inadmissible.<br /><br />they bring up the words &quot;on the other hand&quot;.... on the other hand does NOT mean &quot;lets ties this to that&quot; in terms of a transition. &quot;on the other hand&quot; is a transition into a completely different subject. its always been used as a seg-way from one topic to another. it has NEVER been used to link topic one with topic two. I also want to point out that most likely, the Ukraine president wasn&#39;t speaking ENGLISH, it was being TRANSLATED to English. who translated? was it someone on the Ukraine side? or the US side? because then there would be an issue with translations! which no one talks about because this whole thing is a sham.<br /><br />he even points out, &quot;we don&#39;t follow legal rulings we have our own&quot; except that when this all goes through (if it does) it will turn into a legal hearing. which then all of their &quot;proof&quot; which IS 100% hearsay, will get thrown out. we have already heard that ONE PERSON has told many others, that there was a quid pro quo. but that person who claims so, never KNEW it, they presumed it, and presumptions do not fit in court. which proves again, that this whole thing live on tv for all to watch is to sway minds to make them vote democrat.<br /><br />this idea that you cannot as president ask another country to look into corruption because &quot;they are going to be running in 2020&quot; is ridiculous. so you are gonna tell me, that its OKAY for biden to be corrupt, because &quot;hes a 2020 candidate&quot;. WHAT? so when he wins, we have to ignore all his corruption? would they impeach him for corruption? NO THEY WONT. hes part of the deep state!<br /><br />seeing EVERYTHING up to this very video, and previous videos. I can only come to ONE conclusion. Biden is the DEEP STATE puppet for 2020, and they are hoping he wins, but he wont win if his corruption comes out, because it would absolutely ruin him EVER becoming president. They are SCARED Trump will win again.<br /><br />They also state that the american people are scared of trump. NO ONE is &quot;&quot;SCARED&quot;&quot; of Trump. Him being president doesn&#39;t mean anything in terms of being a bad ass. I could call trump names all day long. Nothing will ever happen to me. I don&#39;t even like Trump as a PERSON, but I can&#39;t deny he has made America GREAT AGAIN. Don&#39;t let HATE blind you to TRUTH. You can still HATE Trump, but don&#39;t let it BLIND you.<br /><br />as far as a THREAT goes, of all it takes if for me to say &quot;I feel threatened&quot; based of my FEELINGS instead of FACT, then I am threatened by the DEMOCRATS and thus they all have to leave office right now.... but that&#39;s not gonna happen now is it. these democrats sound like fucking children.....<br /><br />TWITTER tweets are not an abuse of power.... ROFL<br /><br />they complain that Trump told people not to testify.... but who didn&#39;t testify? they aren&#39;t stating ANY FACTS. they only CLAIM it.... and IF Trump told them not to Testify, they could subpoena them forcing them to show up!!!! They did not do this, because they don&#39;t CARE if they show up. its all a SHOW.<br /><br />THEY ALSO Claim that those who did testify, were not allowed to submit documents. all they have to do is SUBPOENA them! bam, no one can say no! but they don&#39;t want to use LAW, because then Biden would be FUCKED.<br /><br />NOW near the end they CLAIM they IGNORED subpoenas..... no they didn&#39;t..... absolute horseshit. Ignoring a Subpoena puts you in JAIL.
