Regardless thank you for DBZA!!! \ud83d\ude22 it's hard not to be sentimental when that show helped pull me through one of  the darkest chapters of life. So hats off and  thank all of you for your hard work. I'm hoping, as I'm sure many are, that this is just a temporary thing.

There are so many of us that have grown to love you all as creators as much as we have grown to love DBZA, whether it be through your other series', your twitch streams, etc (personally i loved 'Sakero: Shadows Drink Twice' and your 'Shenmue' playthrough). So even with DBZA concluding, you all still mean a lot to us for your entire body of works. Nobody should ask you to jeopardize your channel, your employees/friends, or the quality of the series itself by pressuring you into continuing it when it all signs point to it being a bad decision. \n\n\nI guess if i had to summarize, i would say this. i appreciate the transparency (a LOT), i respect your personal/financial/artistic decision, and i greatly look forward to whatever you do in the future. Whenever the bell notifies me, i'll be watching.\n\n\nSincerely, your fans", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-17T02:56:36.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-17T02:56:36.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/oSs3-u1e_s_Tu4gvu1XZmt40QrQ\"", "id": "UgwuBReVkaJN9FNsnt94AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "vZy8D4B8LLs", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/T3eTpC6WIN73ePlABjk6D6Exot8\"", "id": "UgwuBReVkaJN9FNsnt94AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "TheKingofFive", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_kLfnpHIxLB3PSx0aGx4Ji4e-__MjpngWA1Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsOwDfL4sF1E3-yCUgt5Pdg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCsOwDfL4sF1E3-yCUgt5Pdg"}, "videoId": "vZy8D4B8LLs", "textDisplay": "This was a huge part of my life for a long time.
