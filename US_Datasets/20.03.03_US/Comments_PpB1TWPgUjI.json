Don't lose that hope, Hannah! You and he still have many years together on this Earth and maybe one day he'll see the light. Think of how beautiful that could be.

And she was a &#39;narcissistic parent.&#39; I grew up sick, grinding my teeth every night, scared, nervous, upset, alone, lonely, a hopeless romantic, you name it. When I met my husband I learned how she was was TOXIC. everyday that my husband and I hung out when we dated she made me feel guilty, bad, selfish you name it. And tbh I was happy. I was in love. I was becoming an adult. Doing adult things adult this didn&#39;t &quot;fit or work&#39; for her lifestyle and goals. She flat out told me that she wanted me to stay and never leave. Never have a life. Well, I went no contact for the last 2 years of her life. I married, had a child, a home and a life. I finally did my own thing. I finally became a woman. Loved, not scared and nervous. I realized why I was why I was. I realized I deserved so much. When she passed away I had 0 regrets that we didn&#39;t talk. That we didn&#39;t &quot;make up&quot; going NO CONTACT is OKAY with your parents. We owe them nothing. Nothing. We deserve love and sometimes parents aren&#39;t it.
