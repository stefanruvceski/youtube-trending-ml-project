Last time I suggested that if a universe could be created in a lab (I saw Lenny Suskind say this might be possible in an interview), then it's possible that a \"lineage\" of universes might appear which are selected for having conditions amenable to intelligent life and whose physics experiment would create still more universes. At first I thought Matt was explaining the idea I talked about, which had me feeling pretty smart and/or smug, but then I saw that what he's describing is related but different. \n\nOf course, it's also interesting that we have several possible multiverse theories which don't seem to be mutually exclusive.

So some universes that are within the same parent universe could affect another universe (2 black holes interacting with each other within a parent universe), but not with universes that are within separate parent universes? Possibly ones that have a mutual grandparent universe and can interact with each other, but not the grandchild universes? You know like in the tree on the graph on the video, universes from separate branches can&#39;t affect with each other, but separate branches overall could on the parent/grandparent level.<br />- if every black hole is a new universe, what happens when 2 black holes collide? Do 2 universes with their unique properties mix into one somehow? Or is it a new universe forming replacing the former 2? What happens to the properties of the mixed universe and/or the new universe replacing the former 2? What happens to the stuff, the worlds/realities of the former 2 universes? What happens to the black holes and child universes within those 2 collided ones?<br />- Is maybe the big bang actually the implosion of a star into a black hole and it only looks like the universe is expanding from our perspective, but in reality it&#39;s just continuously eating up whatever falls inside from the parent universe? Which could possible also explain the uneven matter/antimatter ratios and stuff - the things falling into the black hole from the parent universe are not in even ratios themselves and hence they kick our internal ratios off the balance?<br />- is the new stuff sucked in by a black hole in the parent universe capable of changing the constants and general parameters of the child universe?<br />- is there a top grand-grand-grand-(...)-grand-grandparent universe of all other universes? Where did THAT come from, how, etc.? (I know this is impossible to answer but that question just begs to be asked lol) same as what those other universes are like, whether they have time, space, matter, or just stuff completely unimaginable and possibly unintuitive/illogical for human mind because of it being a product of our universe and whatever happens outside a given universe is just inconceivable for products of that universe? Or is there maybe gradation, that we could figure out what the universes within the black holes in our universe are like, so we can learn what child universes of out universe are like as they are a product of our universe after all, but figuring out what our universe&#39;s parent, grandparent, etc. universes are like is impossible? And especially the very bottom arche-pan-universe of all?<br />- if stuff from the parent universes is being eaten up by the black holes, isn&#39;t the arche-parent going to run out of stuff to be eaten up? Is it finite or infinite? If infinite, then how come? How does it work (I know we can&#39;t know, like in the previous question)? And if finite, does it mean that at some point every parent in the lineage will eventually become desolate with nothing but black holes? Which means eventually our universe will become so as well and to survive we will need to figure out how to move into one of our black holes that will be able to produce further black holes on the inside and so on? So there would be indeed a sort of a cycle of life of younger generations feeding on older generations, etc. - and once there is nothing but black holes left in a parent universe, what happens to the empty space? Won&#39;t it implode at some point, sucked up by the black holes? Won&#39;t the black holes within a dead universe at some point merge? And if yes, it it possible that at some point all of the universes would merge back and there will be only the original pan-arche-universe again?", "textOriginal": "A few complete layman's questions.\n- If black holes produce new universes, does it mean that every universe is within another universe?

What happens to the properties of the mixed universe and/or the new universe replacing the former 2? What happens to the stuff, the worlds/realities of the former 2 universes? What happens to the black holes and child universes within those 2 collided ones?\n- Is maybe the big bang actually the implosion of a star into a black hole and it only looks like the universe is expanding from our perspective, but in reality it's just continuously eating up whatever falls inside from the parent universe? Which could possible also explain the uneven matter/antimatter ratios and stuff - the things falling into the black hole from the parent universe are not in even ratios themselves and hence they kick our internal ratios off the balance?\n- is the new stuff sucked in by a black hole in the parent universe capable of changing the constants and general parameters of the child universe?\n- is there a top grand-grand-grand-(...)-grand-grandparent universe of all other universes? Where did THAT come from, how, etc.? (I know this is impossible to answer but that question just begs to be asked lol) same as what those other universes are like, whether they have time, space, matter, or just stuff completely unimaginable and possibly unintuitive/illogical for human mind because of it being a product of our universe and whatever happens outside a given universe is just inconceivable for products of that universe? Or is there maybe gradation, that we could figure out what the universes within the black holes in our universe are like, so we can learn what child universes of out universe are like as they are a product of our universe after all, but figuring out what our universe's parent, grandparent, etc. universes are like is impossible? And especially the very bottom arche-pan-universe of all?\n- if stuff from the parent universes is being eaten up by the black holes, isn't the arche-parent going to run out of stuff to be eaten up? Is it finite or infinite? If infinite, then how come? How does it work (I know we can't know, like in the previous question)? And if finite, does it mean that at some point every parent in the lineage will eventually become desolate with nothing but black holes? Which means eventually our universe will become so as well and to survive we will need to figure out how to move into one of our black holes that will be able to produce further black holes on the inside and so on? So there would be indeed a sort of a cycle of life of younger generations feeding on older generations, etc. - and once there is nothing but black holes left in a parent universe, what happens to the empty space? Won't it implode at some point, sucked up by the black holes? Won't the black holes within a dead universe at some point merge? And if yes, it it possible that at some point all of the universes would merge back and there will be only the original pan-arche-universe again?", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2019-12-18T13:09:24.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-18T13:53:06.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 1, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/w2dgP94MPxQmu9Dsk4dibYNYG78\"", "id": "Ugw1-ZDyzeCz-VHIoPN4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rFgpKlcpzNM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/M6vOtFaMPJFRGRpnr_In6iB9bx0\"", "id": "Ugw1-ZDyzeCz-VHIoPN4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Oscar Berggren", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79H5yFQO3UspFV0_9NbwJztfj8qD0Ucrag9dQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgc5r9q5svF3lPYbyez6CHA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgc5r9q5svF3lPYbyez6CHA"}, "videoId": "rFgpKlcpzNM", "textDisplay": "You never brought up primordial black holes.
