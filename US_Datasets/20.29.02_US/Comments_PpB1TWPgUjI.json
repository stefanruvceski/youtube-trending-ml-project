but I definitely understand the situation and have experienced something similar. There&#39;s already too much antisemitism in the world and I don&#39;t want to add fuel to the fire so here&#39;s a disclaimer: I am Jewish because I want to be, because I like the religion and find beauty in it. I chose to go through the process of converting for the sake of marrying my fiancee. It was excruciating and made my family feel like I was abandoning them for a family that didn&#39;t accept me as I was. I can handle his family not liking me, I almost expect that regardless of who I date (not that I&#39;m unlikable, just because I&#39;m insecure). What I found hard, was the feeling that my partner might have chose his family over our love if I didn&#39;t officially convert. That it&#39;s &quot;unconditional love&quot; on the condition that I&#39;m Jewish. Since converting, I have strayed from the religion, for many reasons, and wonder if I&#39;m disappointing him. I feel like a fraud, that I scammed him into loving my under the pretense that I would be religious and will he still love me if I&#39;m not? We have been together for 9 years and we are getting married in a few months and I know that he truly loves me and that we&#39;re soulmates. But it&#39;s still something I struggle with internally, asking myself if I would be enough, or if he would still choose me if I decided not to convert. Would his family be upset but eventually come around to it or would we have to elope because we don&#39;t have the support of his family to have a wedding, or even want to attend our ceremony. Knowing that they were against us dating for so many years has made me feel uncomfortable to be around them even if they now welcome me with open arms after the conversion. Being from the outside, secular world, looking in, it absolutely seems like a cult as do all religions at this point.

Your pain is justified, even if you saw it coming a mile away, it hurts to be less important than religion (or a cult). Your family should want to celebrate your happiness even if it doesn&#39;t agree with their ideology.. In fact, just the fact that you are happy should be enough to change their ideology. You are worthy of all the love and happiness and I&#39;m so sorry that you have to deal with this. I wish you nothing but the best and that you are able to resolve this, whatever that may mean. You are loved and you don&#39;t need their validation to know that, even if you want it. He&#39;s an idiot if he&#39;s choosing to miss out on your life and the love you could have if he let you in.

I send you all the love I possibly can. \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-02-29T17:19:36.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-29T17:19:36.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/sEM8ifllxEba0hf3_ICfVnlqSDU\"", "id": "UgyfhDHRWNP0hr2Nd014AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "PpB1TWPgUjI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/ZOIZ_V9WDcm81moVTwgQZGfNOis\"", "id": "UgyfhDHRWNP0hr2Nd014AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Jared Cook", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJytPdY3NlZELbzJfO0vYOkW3i9_oVuUNRveMw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3H8Fqzs_vpXWmE0yJyyAw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-3H8Fqzs_vpXWmE0yJyyAw"}, "videoId": "PpB1TWPgUjI", "textDisplay": "Always remember family is who you choose to label as such, particularly for us in the GRSM (Gender, Romantic, and Sexual Minorities) community.

I have watched your platform grow into a thing that has actually changed the world, and made corners of it better and safer.\n\nI am so proud of you. I can only imagine how difficult this whole journey has been. I have been struggling with my relationship with my mother. This video has given me perspective that I really needed. Thank you.\n\nThank you for your vulnerability. Thank you for sharing your struggles and your triumphs. Thank you for sharing the heart of Hart. I am ever thankful and grateful for your presence in the world. And I am ecstatic about your adventures and so excited for the life that you get to lead in love with Ella.\n\nThank you.
