Ham to lead and command The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) and its successors under the guidance of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and with their full support. <br /><br />Should it become necessary to suppress commercial mercenary forces operating under the guise of being federal government agencies including but not limited to the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, etc., General Ham shall assume immediate command and control of all armed forces and services owed to The United States of America (major) stationed in North America and shall join them under his Command as The Grand Army of the Republic. All forces of air, land, and sea are to be employed. <br /><br />Any cost or loss suffered as a result of deployment of The Grand Army of the Republic shall be charged as stipulated prior. <br /><br />All effort shall be made by The Grand Army of the Republic to spare life and property while undertaking any action whatsoever within the states of the Union without exception. The GAR is uniquely enabled by these Orders to operate on the land of the fifty (50) organic states for the purposes of securing the lives and property of the American States and American State Citizens. The GAR is not a foreign army and is composed primarily of American State Citizens. <br /><br />If required to take field position, the local commanders shall make every effort to communicate the basis of their authority and the reasons for their presence on American State soil to ensure a prompt cessation of hostilities and a widespread understanding of the usurpations and acts of fraud which have led to any conflict. All parties must be brought to understand the nature of the federal government, the limitations of its authority, and their own obligation to act in favor of the organic states of the Union. The Grand Army of the Republic shall continue to operate under General Order 100 known as the Lieber Code, extant from the pen of the last Republic President, Abraham Lincoln. <br /><br />No orders, Executive or otherwise, issued by Barack H. Obama pretending authority on the land of the American States while operating as \u201cPresident\u201d of the UNITED STATES Corporation nor as the \u201cPresident\u201d of the United States of America (minor) are owed any performance by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Ham, or any Ordinary. All plainly stated grants of contractual authority evident in The Constitution for the united States of America remain in place, subject to good faith performance of the accompanying obligations and treaties. <br /><br />Mr. Obama is the \u201cPresident\u201d of a governmental services corporation under contract to provide stipulated services to the organic states and is on their payroll. He otherwise acts as a foreign dignitary representing the United States of America (minor). In neither of these capacities is he allowed any granted authority to impose upon American State Citizens, endanger American State property, or command mercenary forces on American State soil, however veiled as federal civilian service agencies. We require the Joint Chiefs of Staff and General Ham to commence measures to disarm federal civilian agency personnel and to seize control of the vast stockpiles of arms which have been improperly amassed by \u201cthe Department of Homeland Security\u201d, FEMA, and other agencies employed by the UNITED STATES. <br /><br />The only federal agency allowed free egress on the land of the American States is the U.S. Marshals Service, and then only when their personnel are engaged in their duty to protect the U.S. Mail and sworn to act as constitutional officers.

Ham to lead and command The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) and its successors under the guidance of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and with their full support. \n\nShould it become necessary to suppress commercial mercenary forces operating under the guise of being federal government agencies including but not limited to the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, etc., General Ham shall assume immediate command and control of all armed forces and services owed to The United States of America (major) stationed in North America and shall join them under his Command as The Grand Army of the Republic. All forces of air, land, and sea are to be employed. \n\nAny cost or loss suffered as a result of deployment of The Grand Army of the Republic shall be charged as stipulated prior. \n\nAll effort shall be made by The Grand Army of the Republic to spare life and property while undertaking any action whatsoever within the states of the Union without exception. The GAR is uniquely enabled by these Orders to operate on the land of the fifty (50) organic states for the purposes of securing the lives and property of the American States and American State Citizens. The GAR is not a foreign army and is composed primarily of American State Citizens. \n\nIf required to take field position, the local commanders shall make every effort to communicate the basis of their authority and the reasons for their presence on American State soil to ensure a prompt cessation of hostilities and a widespread understanding of the usurpations and acts of fraud which have led to any conflict. All parties must be brought to understand the nature of the federal government, the limitations of its authority, and their own obligation to act in favor of the organic states of the Union. The Grand Army of the Republic shall continue to operate under General Order 100 known as the Lieber Code, extant from the pen of the last Republic President, Abraham Lincoln. \n\nNo orders, Executive or otherwise, issued by Barack H. Obama pretending authority on the land of the American States while operating as \u201cPresident\u201d of the UNITED STATES Corporation nor as the \u201cPresident\u201d of the United States of America (minor) are owed any performance by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Ham, or any Ordinary. All plainly stated grants of contractual authority evident in The Constitution for the united States of America remain in place, subject to good faith performance of the accompanying obligations and treaties. \n\nMr. Obama is the \u201cPresident\u201d of a governmental services corporation under contract to provide stipulated services to the organic states and is on their payroll. He otherwise acts as a foreign dignitary representing the United States of America (minor). In neither of these capacities is he allowed any granted authority to impose upon American State Citizens, endanger American State property, or command mercenary forces on American State soil, however veiled as federal civilian service agencies. We require the Joint Chiefs of Staff and General Ham to commence measures to disarm federal civilian agency personnel and to seize control of the vast stockpiles of arms which have been improperly amassed by \u201cthe Department of Homeland Security\u201d, FEMA, and other agencies employed by the UNITED STATES. \n\nThe only federal agency allowed free egress on the land of the American States is the U.S. Marshals Service, and then only when their personnel are engaged in their duty to protect the U.S. Mail and sworn to act as constitutional officers. All other federal agency personnel are limited to unarmed service until further notice. \n\nWe direct the Joint Chiefs of Staff to communicate these first two General Civil Orders directly to Mr. Obama, the members of the \u201cUS Congress\u201d, the administrators of all \u201cfederal\u201d agencies, the members of the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d and those acting as \u201cGovernors\u201d to compel their rapid understanding and cooperation. \n\nAny expense or damage incurred by these organic states or any American State Citizen as a result of actions undertaken by any federal agency personnel acting as armed mercenaries on American State soil will be understood as the result of violent crimes committed against the peaceful inhabitants of the land and will incur immediate judgment liquidating the assets of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Federal Reserve (FEDERAL RESERVE) in payment of the stipulated reparations.
