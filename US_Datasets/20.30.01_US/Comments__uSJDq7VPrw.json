she\u2019s a good friend of mine too. i\u2019m so well behaved, of course i\u2019m pretty independent with my own business at 16 & i\u2019m almost never home. but when i am home we talk about everything, i\u2019m so open to her. i don\u2019t lie to her about where i am or what i\u2019m doing. i don\u2019t drink without her permission, i don\u2019t do drugs or smoke. i\u2019m happily open with her and i\u2019ll listen to her when she says no. because she\u2019s fair with the amounts of freedom she gives me. i could never go to my dad and tell him everything.", "canRate": true,
