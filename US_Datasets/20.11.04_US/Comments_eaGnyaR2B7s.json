It really is always the tools your not scared of that get you!  I was honing out some holes in some metal strap.  I was trying to rig my drill press into an automated bore honing machine.  These strap segments were kinda sharp so I thought I'd wear gloves...  The 13/32 drill bit (yes, I even know which one it was) grabbed the part, the part grabbed the glove and pulled me in.  The glove wrapped my arm up in the drill press.  The drill cut into my forearm and I now have a 2.5\" scar to remember this all by.  Thankfully, twas but a flesh wound!  I did need stitches, but didn't nick anything important or break my arm as I had initially feared.  Really it didn't even bleed.  I was insanely lucky.  Power tools, even the ones that seem safe, are no joke!\n\n\nAlso, smart move bringing your mom out to stay with you!", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-04-11T00:25:01.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-04-11T00:26:16.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"tnVOtk4NeGU6nDncDTE5m9SmuHc/FBIyDpLIqzwZWoluJhqKiqY4q_I\"", "id": "Ugx4fAdLaVm4ZCmyCVN4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "eaGnyaR2B7s", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"tnVOtk4NeGU6nDncDTE5m9SmuHc/fMt56k6vb_-CoyDH8IdcqDy6P_I\"", "id": "Ugx4fAdLaVm4ZCmyCVN4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Michael underthedome", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxPnL3rFEFu_3kwe-yV2F71SLIibAGLE_iFIw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXL_vLbYqpuLY0FVBcGYRkg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXL_vLbYqpuLY0FVBcGYRkg"}, "videoId": "eaGnyaR2B7s", "textDisplay": "Left hand middle finger.... must be one of the evil satanic pieces of .... cabal is going down dude.", "textOriginal": "Left hand middle finger.... must be one of the evil satanic pieces of .... cabal is going down dude.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-04-11T00:15:43.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-04-11T00:15:43.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"tnVOtk4NeGU6nDncDTE5m9SmuHc/lfT5kLi0PZ5DXQRTSfyaKhD5tV0\"", "id": "Ugya0oV6c6dzXOmpEih4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "eaGnyaR2B7s", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"tnVOtk4NeGU6nDncDTE5m9SmuHc/X9NBmFaf2cyOQzZZUCwugfC2V2M\"", "id": "Ugya0oV6c6dzXOmpEih4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "J.Howard J", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzXs7WevQi4vJVMAOnwbyWZFM7Joiczs50kPA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6eYVV2M_pPsh05gMWJdWYw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6eYVV2M_pPsh05gMWJdWYw"}, "videoId": "eaGnyaR2B7s", "textDisplay": "Let me guess,  you tried to give someone the finger and they really wanted it?<br />Edit: I was right... spoiler... below...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />...his lathe wanted his finger.", "textOriginal": "Let me guess,  you tried to give someone the finger and they really wanted it?\nEdit: I was right... spoiler... below...\n\n\n\n\n...his lathe wanted his finger.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-04-11T00:12:42.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-04-11T00:19:28.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"tnVOtk4NeGU6nDncDTE5m9SmuHc/W-5UaJPnZZuh-FW3zUEPPUI6iUY\"", "id": "UgyBgUGxDKEzmKlh47B4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "eaGnyaR2B7s", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"tnVOtk4NeGU6nDncDTE5m9SmuHc/eMuSuL0zPL9H4N9nIyvYHySYOY4\"", "id": "UgyBgUGxDKEzmKlh47B4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Ali Zaib", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz0rG3dyII7Wzl2eXTNs7k-oy-n1XMp2S3f8w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNIcdj-dOIHIjr1mghMMz-w", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNIcdj-dOIHIjr1mghMMz-w"}, "videoId": "eaGnyaR2B7s", "textDisplay": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaGnyaR2B7s&amp;t=4m06s\">4:06</a> made me chuckle.
