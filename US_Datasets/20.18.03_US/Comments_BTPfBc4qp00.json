So what, are we going to have rolling waves of lockdowns for more than a year, until there's a vaccine? That assumes that there is going to be a workable vaccine, which is not a fact, but a hope.\n\nIf you look at the raw numbers, which Dr. Gupta is specifically not mentioning, you see that a \"flattening the curve\" effort that saves a large number of people would take more than a year, and more likely multiple years, before we get any \"herd immunity\" benefits, if indeed those are going to accrue to us in time. But then again, if our immune responses don't last very long, then the lockdowns will have been an expensive waste of time, because by the time the lockdown ends, it's time for a lockdown against the next infectious strain of the virus to begin.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-18T18:24:45.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-18T18:24:45.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/JiYM1GBT49fTMzPBulylL_4DDTA\"", "id": "UgwLLRWF0dElB3Rvl2B4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "BTPfBc4qp00", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/y91m2y5rvpa-KomIamH1WWTBdF8\"", "id": "UgwLLRWF0dElB3Rvl2B4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Randy Williams", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyqltbjWMVWnj7yJWK3wlJdxNzYaqlrQo4vqA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmERSTcTlUEqstCNEzYTZg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYmERSTcTlUEqstCNEzYTZg"}, "videoId": "BTPfBc4qp00", "textDisplay": "LACK of seriousness!
