Extreme distrust on the medical field because it seem all are incompetent. Currently chair ridden because of doctor incompetence. Doctors common questions: \"Well what do you think you have?\" \"How would you treat that?\" \"What medications would you put yourself on?\" It's like they need their mommy to hold their hand on a daily job, I need a doctor to nut up and answer these questions themselves instead of sitting down on their laptop and shopping on amazon. I've been thinking about doing skits on how bad the medical field is here but worry if they'll look god-awful.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-11T17:29:21.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-11T17:29:56.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/izT3IwNzSMhJa727t4RYzEzueJQ\"", "id": "UgzSZZhmHPP1wayNrv14AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/ggXWRBHXOIvEK_IwBnwyEUIm1Wo\"", "id": "UgzSZZhmHPP1wayNrv14AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Taylor Anderson", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79y9F8WAtxVQMzqs8_Slt9k5wu-RFU4toQnUQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3dmp5ttXl-um_I5d4CUsOA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3dmp5ttXl-um_I5d4CUsOA"}, "videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "textDisplay": "When I was 14 I went in to the Emergency Room for chest pain the first thing they did after they weighed me was get me in for an EKG.
