None of this is even backed up by anything, it&#39;s just to pick peoples&#39; brains.<br /><br />What I think a black hole is:\r<br />\r<br />1: Black holes aren&#39;t created through supernova&#39;s. When a star massive enough begins fusing iron, more and more heavy elements\r<br />are created and the core gets gradually denser under the extreme increases in mass density from above it. This process\r<br />continues and here is where the difference between the creation of a neutron star and a black hole is determined.\r<br />Matter at the very microscopic gravitational center of the star is crushed densely enough to form neutrons. When those\r<br />neutrons undertake enough gravitational force that pushes them beyond their limits to withstand, an extremely small,\r<br />microscopic, perhaps even quantum scale black hole is created. This is the bell that announces the star&#39;s doom.\r<br />The black hole begins eating the core, the outer core and the rest of the star from the inside out; gaining mass as it does so.\r<br />With the increase in mass, the black hole grows in volume as well, or at least its event horizon grows. Slowly but surely,\r<br />the black hole consumes the entire star from the inside like a parasite born out of its own heart. Now, it&#39;s possible that\r<br />at some point, the star&#39;s outer layers can no longer support being in a spherical shape as the black hole spins and\r<br />collapses into an accretion disk. This event can be seen as a sort of supernova, but it doesn&#39;t have to happen that way.\r<br />The main point is just that the creation of the black hole happens before the supernova happens.\r<br />If there is enough matter left for the black hole to feast on, it can create a quasar so signal its birth.\r<br />Thus a black hole as we know them is formed.\r<br />\r<br />2. What it is now, is anyone&#39;s guess, but I like looking at it like this: The event horizon of a black hole is like an atmosphere.\r<br />But instead of an atmosphere of matter, it&#39;s an atmosphere of extreme gravity. For all we know, there could be simply nothing\r<br />between the core of a black hole and its event horizon. I believe that to be the case, though I have no real empirical basis\r<br />to support that claim. Instead, a black hole&#39;s mass is concentrated only right at its core. We call it a singularity, which I\r<br />know to be physics jargon for: I don&#39;t know what the fuck it is, but it&#39;s massive and unimaginably dense!\r<br />Now for this part I&#39;d like to hear from quantum physisists and partical physisists. When neutrons are crushed beyond their limits,\r<br />what sort of matter do you get? Whatever it is, to me the only form of matter or anything else with mass that could exist in these\r<br />conditions, is just pure energy. Energy comes in all forms, shapes and magnitudes. It doesn&#39;t care a lick how it&#39;s constituted,\r<br />all it cares about is that it cannot be destroyed or created. Mass and matter is simply a concentration of pure energy,\r<br />as Einstein has proved. And it&#39;s this concentration that has the ability to distort space-time. That distortion is gravity.\r<br />Why should the singularity be any different? All it can be is energy in a form we just don&#39;t understand yet. It may not even\r<br />care about the concept of volume anymore either: for all we know, every black hole&#39;s core, no matter how massive, is of the same\r<br />volume. All the mass it eats simply gets transformed into the same form of energy it is made out of and just becomes a part of it.\r<br />A black hole&#39;s core could be equally probable to be the same size it started at the very moment it was born: no bigger, perhaps even\r<br />smaller than an atom, or grow as it eats.\r<br />Of course, I can equally support the idea that a black hole&#39;s core does grow in volume with an increase in mass. Information\r<br />must be stored somehow, perhaps on its surface. It&#39;s just that, those concepts we have of volume being needed to store information\r<br />might just not apply to a singularity. Physics as we know it doesn&#39;t work down here. When thinking of things existing in conditions\r<br />like these, I think it&#39;s best to assume nothing from the laws we have so far uncovered, only keeping them on the side as \r<br />guidelines instead.\r<br />\r<br />3. Lastly, this is about what the consequences are of the black hole&#39;s existance in regards to space-time are.\r<br />The first question I think we need to answer here is: can space-time tear? We know it&#39;s malleable and that energy deforms it.\r<br />But if enough energy is concentrated in one place like with a black hole, would the singularity be able to tear through\r<br />space-time itself? If the answer is no, then all you will find down there is just the black hole&#39;s core.\r<br />If the answer is yes, then a black hole can serve as a portal through space-time. Where you will end up in, nobody knows,\r<br />I don&#39;t even have any speculation other than that it is either another place within the universe or another universe\r<br />altogether. What I do believe strongly is that regardless of either, managing the trip would mean travel through time and not just\r<br />space. There are just two issues with achieving this:\r<br />1: you&#39;d need to be able to somehow retain the structure and constitution of your own information while traveling down the black hole,\r<br />I.E how not to get crushed to bits. You&#39;d probably need an amount of energy greater than what the black hole is made of in order\r<br />to resist it.\r<br />2: How to navigate. Getting into contact with the black hole&#39;s core is probably a death sentence for all eternity. It would\r<br />also be the center of the portal, which is perhaps only microscopic anyway. One would need to devise a method by which they\r<br />could slip into the portal and not touch the singularity.\r<br />\r<br />4. I hope this might have tickled some of those physics eggheads&#39;s brains. I&#39;m just a writer with a high-school degree with a \r<br />minor interest in this sort of stuff. I do not have any real, empirical basis to support any of this.
