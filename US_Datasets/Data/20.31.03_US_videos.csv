As it has for so, so many of us, this global pandemic has absolutely flipped our world upside down. What went from a virus that seemed far away in China, quickly made it‚Äôs way across the globe forcing us to quarantine in our 60 sq-ft in Morocco. And while quarantining was going well for us it became apparent that things would be different for a long while.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. The gravity of what we‚Äôve just done hasn‚Äôt quite sunk in and we ((especially me (Bec)) are having a really hard time adjusting to our new reality.  Having said that we think the most important thing we can all do now is STAY HOME, keep healthy with healing foods & try to look at this as a time that we (and the planet) desperately needed to reset and realign.  Sending each of you so much love throughout this time x‚ú≥ Eamon & Bec Products ‚ú≥‚Ü† our handmade chai blends https://chaiwalachai.com/ ‚Üû‚Ü† our plant-based cookbook https://www.eamonandbec.com/weekday-whip-ups ‚Üû‚Ü† our beautiful photo filters https://www.eamonandbec.com/presets ‚ÜûTour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantourOVERLANDING AFRICA IN OUR SPRINTER VAN has been the adventure we‚Äôve always hoped it would be but it‚Äôs hard to predict what happens next. In fact, we are still processing everything that has happened over the last week and continues to happen... No one knows where we will end up, where our beloved tiny home on wheels will make it or for how long this pandemic will take over life as we know but all we can do is try to remain positive and move forward in the direction that feels right for us.

Experts say aggressive diagnostic testing is essential in order to learn where and how an epidemic spreads. But in the critical first weeks of the outbreak in the U.S., one problem after another prevented doctors, clinics, and labs around the country from testing enough people. Patients in America were being sent home as hospitals rationed their test supply, while other countries like South Korea found a way to test hundreds of thousands of people quickly. Now, the U.S. is months behind in understanding the true scope of the virus. Testing capacity is finally ramping up, but is it too late?¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision¬ª Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

In this video, I‚Äôm going to show you that this is not something to be fearful of as long as you avoid these 10 most common home workout mistakes. In fact, it is possible to build muscle at home with little to no equipment if you get all of these right. So that said, let‚Äôs dive in and start making sure you are.First, you must not focus so much on the equipment that you don‚Äôt have and instead look around at the opportunities you do have. I covered in a recent home workout video how you have countertops, stairs, doorways, hardwood floors and even tables that you can use to get a complete total body workout with nothing but your own bodyweight. Watch that if you feel like you are out of ideas for what to do now that your gym is closed.Next, in a rush to overcompensate for the lack of a gym people will attempt to do home workouts and exercises that are simply too difficult for them. What happens here is that they either get hurt or just become discouraged when the results aren‚Äôt satisfactory. This is because they would have gotten much more out of doing the exercises that were appropriate for them and that they had done with proper form and intensity.Third, exercise variety is key when it comes to training at home. This is not because you are trying to create muscle confusion or ‚Äúshock the muscles‚Äù. Instead, this is because the variety of home exercises is what provides the easiest path for overload. Slight changes to the same exercise can provide a totally unique stimulus to the muscles you are trying to train and lead to new muscle gains.Speaking of overload, the fourth mistake relates to how many will program for it in the form of specific rep counts with home and bodyweight workouts. This is a mistake. One size does not fit all when it comes to calisthenics. Instead, train to failure or just shy to ensure that you are neither underserving or over serving your abilities in your workouts.The fifth biggest home workout mistake is relying too much on cardio or hiit movements instead of strength building exercises. Look, I love burpees, mountain climbers and jumping jacks but they are not going to build muscle. Doing too many of them in your home workout routines will cause you to lose muscle instead of build it. You need to focus the majority of your efforts on exercises that build muscle like pullups, handstand pushups and more.The sixth biggest mistake is forgetting to train your back at home. Not only will this lead to an underwhelming physique but it will create muscle imbalances that lead directly to the seventh mistake and that is bad posture.Finally, the last three relate to the implementation of your workout routine into a new routine. If you don‚Äôt plan to get your workout in at home it is too easy to find yourself being too random and skipping your workout all together. Schedule it into your day and FaceTime a friend if needed to hold yourself accountable. Don‚Äôt do it in your living room either if you can avoid it. Too tempting to hit the couch during a rest period and never get off of it.To build muscle at home you have to be willing to avoid the biggest workout mistakes. These are just a few of the things that people tend to do at home when they are doing total body workouts that hinder the muscle gains that they see. If you want to build muscle at home and do it without equipment you have to use a workout that doesn't make mistakes like these.If you are looking for a complete home workout program that doesn‚Äôt require any equipment at all, be sure to head to athleanx.com and check out the ATHLEAN XERO program.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right‚Äîwithin two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez.

As Abigail Bimman reports, while Trudeau said Canadians' efforts are helping to curb the spread, more still needs to be done. Meanwhile, Jennifer Johnson reports on the staggering statistics that reveal one person is dying every 17 minutes in New York, as the U.S. scrambles to source medical supplies to slow the spread of the pandemic.Europe has passed two grim COVID-19 milestones, after the continent reported twenty thousand deaths linked to the virus, half of which occurred in Italy. As Redmond Shannon explains, while several countries have already imposed lockdowns, these measures are expected to become even more severe. The Bank of Canada dropped its key lending rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a nationwide drop in mortgage rates. As Robin Gill reports, the pandemic is forcing realtors to adapt to cooling sales in recently hot markets. As the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are adjusting to the strict social distancing measures imposed, including self-isolation. Reggie Cecchini looks at how people are passing the time.

During a pandemic, it's a necessity.Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labIn most developed countries, workers have the right to a certain number of paid sick days. It‚Äôs a policy that isn‚Äôt rooted in just generosity ‚Äî during pandemics like the novel coronavirus, it can literally save lives. When workers have to choose between earning a living and staying home sick, it incentivizes them to come to work when they're ill, and potentially infect their colleagues and anyone else they come into contact with. That‚Äôs why public health officials are concerned that millions of American workers don‚Äôt have access to paid sick days. And a disproportionate share of those workers are concentrated in occupations like food service and hospitality, where there‚Äôs potential to infect the hundreds of customers many of them interact with every day.Correction: At 1:18, islands in Canada, Denmark, Japan, Italy, and Australia are missing highlights.Previous headline: One policy that changes the coronavirus mathFurther reading:The Italian Ministry of Health https://www.thelocal.it/20200309/map-which-parts-of-italy-are-affected-by-coronavirus-outbreakWorld Health Organizationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic#/media/File:2020_coronavirus_cases_outside_China.svgCenter for Economic and Policy Researchhttps://media.milanote.com/p/files/1Jcvmg1vhFTY82/Rt8/CEPR%20-%20paid%20sick%20leave%20in%2022%20countries%20%282020%20update%29.pdfPew Research Centerhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.htmlA Better Balancehttps://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/map-of-paid-sick-time-laws/Milwaukee Journal Sentinelhttp://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/33874059.htmlWisconsin State Legislaturehttps://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb23PR Watchhttps://www.prwatch.org/files/ALEC%20Labor%20Business%20Reg%20Subcttee%20Annual%20Mtg%202011.pdf#8Economic Policy Institutehttps://www.epi.org/preemption-map/House Democrats (via CNN)https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/coronavirus-house-economic-bill/index.htmlUS House of Representativeshttps://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200309/BILLS-116hr6201-SUS.pdfThe New York Timeshttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-paid-sick-leave.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=HomepageVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
