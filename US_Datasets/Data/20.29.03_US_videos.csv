Experts say aggressive diagnostic testing is essential in order to learn where and how an epidemic spreads. But in the critical first weeks of the outbreak in the U.S., one problem after another prevented doctors, clinics, and labs around the country from testing enough people. Patients in America were being sent home as hospitals rationed their test supply, while other countries like South Korea found a way to test hundreds of thousands of people quickly. Now, the U.S. is months behind in understanding the true scope of the virus.

As Abigail Bimman reports, while Trudeau said Canadians' efforts are helping to curb the spread, more still needs to be done. Meanwhile, Jennifer Johnson reports on the staggering statistics that reveal one person is dying every 17 minutes in New York, as the U.S. scrambles to source medical supplies to slow the spread of the pandemic.Europe has passed two grim COVID-19 milestones, after the continent reported twenty thousand deaths linked to the virus, half of which occurred in Italy. As Redmond Shannon explains, while several countries have already imposed lockdowns, these measures are expected to become even more severe. The Bank of Canada dropped its key lending rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a nationwide drop in mortgage rates. As Robin Gill reports, the pandemic is forcing realtors to adapt to cooling sales in recently hot markets. As the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are adjusting to the strict social distancing measures imposed, including self-isolation.

I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right‚Äîwithin two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he‚Äôs only only getting better with time."

During a pandemic, it's a necessity.Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labIn most developed countries, workers have the right to a certain number of paid sick days. It‚Äôs a policy that isn‚Äôt rooted in just generosity ‚Äî during pandemics like the novel coronavirus, it can literally save lives. When workers have to choose between earning a living and staying home sick, it incentivizes them to come to work when they're ill, and potentially infect their colleagues and anyone else they come into contact with. That‚Äôs why public health officials are concerned that millions of American workers don‚Äôt have access to paid sick days. And a disproportionate share of those workers are concentrated in occupations like food service and hospitality, where there‚Äôs potential to infect the hundreds of customers many of them interact with every day.Correction: At 1:18, islands in Canada, Denmark, Japan, Italy, and Australia are missing highlights.Previous headline: One policy that changes the coronavirus mathFurther reading:The Italian Ministry of Health https://www.thelocal.it/20200309/map-which-parts-of-italy-are-affected-by-coronavirus-outbreakWorld Health Organizationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic#/media/File:2020_coronavirus_cases_outside_China.svgCenter for Economic and Policy Researchhttps://media.milanote.com/p/files/1Jcvmg1vhFTY82/Rt8/CEPR%20-%20paid%20sick%20leave%20in%2022%20countries%20%282020%20update%29.pdfPew Research Centerhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.htmlA Better Balancehttps://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/map-of-paid-sick-time-laws/Milwaukee Journal Sentinelhttp://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/33874059.htmlWisconsin State Legislaturehttps://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb23PR Watchhttps://www.prwatch.org/files/ALEC%20Labor%20Business%20Reg%20Subcttee%20Annual%20Mtg%202011.pdf#8Economic Policy Institutehttps://www.epi.org/preemption-map/House Democrats (via CNN)https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/coronavirus-house-economic-bill/index.htmlUS House of Representativeshttps://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200309/BILLS-116hr6201-SUS.pdfThe New York Timeshttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-paid-sick-leave.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=HomepageVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Patients come to Hospital La Fuenfria for long-term, palliative care and Moreno, who has worked as a nurse for 16 years, found a sense of purpose in bringing them care and company at the end of their lives. Now, he and his colleagues worry that they‚Äôre doing harm. A few days before we spoke, patients at the facility started testing positive for COVID-19. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where it came from,‚Äù Moreno said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know whether we, the staff, brought it here. We don‚Äôt know whether it was due to the patients‚Äô visitors. We don‚Äôt know the source.‚Äù The hospital has cut off all visits. Staffers now take exhaustive precautions when working with patients who have tested positive‚Äîputting on protective equipment they dispose of in contaminated rooms and washing their hands on both sides of the door. But there‚Äôs still a degree of uncertainty. When we spoke, Morena hadn‚Äôt been tested, and Spain‚Äôs health ministry says health workers currently make up nearly 14-percent of positive cases. Now, as the country scrambles to contain the virus it‚Äôs ordered 640,000 test kits from China and Korea in an effort to screen health workers and the most vulnerable. The hope is that this will help identify people who need to self-isolate. Morena isn‚Äôt just thinking of the patients he‚Äôs now caring for. He‚Äôs worried about how long the virus was in the hospital. After a patient with cervical cancer died, a post-mortem X-ray showed her lungs had advanced, bilateral pneumonia. ‚ÄúIt could have been coronavirus, right? She wasn‚Äôt tested,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs like, oh my God, to what extent‚Äîlet‚Äôs see, this needs a pinch of salt but‚Äîwhat if it was me? That's it. So I can‚Äôt hide it, because you really don‚Äôt know. Even with all the security measures in place, you still don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Like everyone working despite an outbreak, Morena worries about infecting his loved ones. ‚ÄúI told this to my colleagues, and we have this kind of sharing moment. We're all going through this bad phase, this suffering.‚Äù But he isn‚Äôt thinking about quitting. ‚ÄúI really find myself fortunate to be able to work because I have the chance to go and feel useful,‚Äù he says. He‚Äôs even volunteered to take on more shifts. ‚ÄúThe healthcare providers, at this moment, we have to be there no matter what. Because if it is not us, who will it be then? There is no one else.‚Äù Subscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-NewsCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.comFollow VICE News here:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenewsTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenewsTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/Instagram: http://instagram.com/vicenewsMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo#VICENews #News"

FOX News operates the FOX News Channel (FNC), FOX Business Network (FBN), FOX News Radio, FOX News Headlines 24/7, FOXNews.com and the direct-to-consumer streaming service, FOX Nation. FOX News also produces FOX News Sunday on FOX Broadcasting Company and FOX News Edge. A top five-cable network, FNC has been the most watched news channel in the country for 17 consecutive years. According to a 2018 Research Intelligencer study by Brand Keys, FOX News ranks as the second most trusted television brand in the country.

More than 15-thousand cases have been confirmed in New York, and around 200 deaths. It's been in lockdown since Sunday, and state officials are pleading for help, but preparing for the worst.US lawmakers have agreed a 2 Trillion dollar stimulus package. After days of wrangling, Democrats and Republicans announced the deal shortly after midnight in Washington. Among the items agreed - adults can receive direct deposits of up to 1,200 dollars - 500 dollars for children. The government will support small businesses with loans to the tune of 367-Bbillion dollars. Hospitals will also get some 150-Bbillion dollars in aid. There will also be half a Ttrillion dollars in guaranteed, subsidised loans to larger industries. Meanwhile China's Hubei province sees the lifting of travel restrictions, where the coronavirus pandemic began in December. Trains are running again, although they're not yet carrying many passengers. Stations are opening up across the province, except in the city of Wuhan, where the corionavirus was first detected. Car drivers there are still being tested, and it will be another two weeks before Wuhan sees its restrictions lifted. It's not only in Hubei where people are now free to go out and about. One family in Beijing is relishing the freedom to roam after weeks cooped up in their apartment.

Click here: https://www.npr.org/tinydeskFollow NPR Music:Twitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusicInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusicMarch 16, 2020 | Lyndsey McKenna and Marissa Lorusso -- Like many who have graced the Tiny Desk before him, the awkwardness of performing in a working office wasn't lost on Harry Styles. It just feels like you're in the way, he joked. But when you watch his set from behind Bob Boilen's desk, you'd never suspect any discomfort.Backed by his touring band, Styles performed several songs from his latest solo album, Fine Line. Between tracks, he talked about the process of writing these songs: From the day off in Nashville that led to Watermelon Sugar, to the feeling of lovesickness he tried to capture in Adore You. The camaraderie between the band was clear; and Styles was in on the joy, twirling in his seat between verses.Styles might not necessarily be the first name that comes to mind when you think of public radio's only working, desk-music-discovery platform. After all, he's got a wildly devoted fanbase that's followed his every move since his One Direction days. In fact, before soundcheck had even started, a crowd of fans had begun to gather outside NPR HQ. They rightly suspected he would be playing a Tiny Desk concert after word got out that the former One Directioner was spotted in D.C. with no tour date on his public schedule.But beyond the headlines, Styles has proven to be an artist who takes his songcraft and aesthetic seriously, interested in subverting expectations of what a pop star can and should sound like in 2020. That sense of unpretentious creativity is exactly what he brought to his Tiny Desk performance ‚Äì and it definitely earned him some new adoring public radio fans in the process.I have to come into NPR more often, Styles said after he and his band played their first song. It's nice here.We ‚Äî and our massive crowd of colleagues ‚Äî couldn't agree more.SET LISTCherryWatermelon SugarTo Be So LonelyAdore YouMUSICIANSHarry Styles: vocals, guitar; Sarah Jones: drums, vocals; Mitch Rowland: guitar; Adam Prendergast: bass, vocals; Ny Oh: guitar, vocals; Charlotte Clark: piano, Wurlitzer, guitar, vocalsCREDITSProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Kara Frame, CJ Riculan, Melany Rochester, Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Max Posner/NPR"

Use ribbon or fabric ties 18‚Äù-20‚Äù in length. For fabric ties: use a strip 1-1/2‚Äùx 18-20‚Äù. Fold one short end 1/4‚Äù in and sew. Next fold the fabric strip long edges in so they meet in the center then fold in half length again. Sew down the open edge to secure. Place the tie with the raw edge next to the corners of the mask just like the elastic was. Tip: Make sure not to sew over the loose end of the tie as you sew around the mask. OPTIONAL: To make the nose are a fit better you can sew a wire ribbon, pipe cleaner, or baggie tie to the lining piece before sewing all three layers together and it would work nicely :)*** Masks are re-usable, but must be sanitized before/after each use! **** Use tightly woven cotton fabric, or hospital grade material.* Keep in mind men and women will be wearing the masks when choosing fabric for mask that will be donated.* Contact local health facilities to see if they are in need of donations. Currently, the supply of surgical masks is at a critical all-time low throughout the entire nation. As a community of sewists, this is a great way we can band together and make a huge difference in this time of need! While handmade fabric face masks are NOT a substitution for N95 masks, in times of emergency, the CDC may allow handmade fabric masks to be used when critical shortages take place. You can read more from the CDC here on the use of homemade masks here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.htmlAccording to the CDC website homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face. In addition to helping medical staff during critical shortages, these masks can be used at home as well. While wearing homemade face masks will not prevent against catching a respiratory illness, they can help reduce the spread of large particles when someone sneezes or coughs. *** PRODUCTS USED **** Fabric: Bonnie and Camille* Juki TL2000 Qi: https://amzn.to/2MYdOZu* Aurifil 50wt Thread: https://amzn.to/33gN1Af* Oliso Pro Smart Iron: https://amzn.to/2ZbppJE* Scissors: https://amzn.to/2tvesWm* Wonder Clips: https://amzn.to/2tr1s4e*** QUILT on the Wall Behind me ***Vintage Spring Quilt Pattern: http://bit.ly/2IMAGw2**** Shop ERICA'S SEWING FAVORITES Here! **** https://www.amazon.com/shop/ericaarndt****  FIND ME HERE **** Email me: erica@confessionsofahomeschooler.comeCourses: http://go.confessionsofahomeschooler.comWebsite: http://www.confessionsofahomeschooler.comStore: http://store.confessionsofahomeschooler.com/COAH Homeschool Community: https://community.confessionsofahomeschooler.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ericaarndt/ YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/EricasHomeschoolFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConfessionsofaHomeschoolerTwitter: http://twitter.com/ericahomeschoolPinterest: http://pinterest.com/ericahomeschoolRavelry: https://www.ravelry.com/people/EricaArndt****  ****  **** Disclosure: This is not a sponsored video.

You might not think they‚Äôd have beef as they rarely saw each other on the court, but as Shaq moved into his role as analyst with a big personality, their adversarial relationship developed. They have a sort of a big brother-little brother relationship. Not in the sense that Shaq looked out for JaVale or anything like that, no certainly not. More in the sense of... Shaq teased JaVale until it became a real fight so vicious Mom had to step in. Seriously their moms got involved.What spurred this beef?  2.75 words: Shaqtin A FoolJaVale McGee was featured on the blooper segment more than any other player, ever. And guess what?
