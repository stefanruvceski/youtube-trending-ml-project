Working in the shadow of an esteemed police veteran (Samuel L. Jackson), brash Detective Ezekiel “Zeke” Banks (Chris Rock) and his rookie partner (Max Minghella) take charge of a grisly investigation into murders that are eerily reminiscent of the city’s gruesome past.  Unwittingly entrapped in a deepening mystery, Zeke finds himself at the center of the killer’s morbid game.SPIRAL stars Chris Rock, Max Minghella, Marisol Nichols, and Samuel L. Jackson, and is produced by the original SAW team of Mark Burg and Oren Koules. The film is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Josh Stolberg & Pete Goldfinger."

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Three boasts a brand new group of celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The White Tiger, The Kangaroo and Miss Monster.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

Can he follow along using verbal instructions only?Check out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pietros-chicken-parmesanAt Pietro’s, the cooks deep fry the chicken cutlets in a large, wide skillet, which allows the oil to come up to temperature very quickly and stay there once the cutlet is added. Smart, but potentially messy (it’s a lot of oil!). If you have a Dutch oven with high sides, that will minimize splatter—we’d feel rotten if you got burned.Rich Brian will be performing at Head in The Clouds Music & Arts Festival Indonesia on March 7, 2020 at JIEXPO Kemayoran, Jakarta.

It is possible to make different waves more than you can imagine if you challenge yourself with your passion(BURN), and go forward.On “THE BACK OF THE MOON”, which no one knows about, instead of a moon that does not shine on its own and always shows the same side, LOOΠΔ serves as a fuse in the heart of the whole LOOΠΔs around the world.Through this album, LOOΠΔ is about to show the whole different confident, challenging LOOΠΔ, not the same LOOΠΔ people all know.Intro ‘#’ gives a hint that whole different album is made in a different space, going over [X X]’s point.The titled song ‘So What’ is an impressive urban dance piece with a grand bass and signature Hornstab, which further maximizes the “girl crush” that LOOΠΔ has not shown before. With the message ‘Break the boundaries that the world has made’ and it added the depth in LOONAVERSE.‘Number 1’ is a 808-bass groove that adds a dreamy atmosphere EP sound with rich harmony and emotional voice, just enough to show another vibe of LOOΠΔ. ‘Oh (Yes I Am)’ is a song that has a clear sound and mysterious vibe that LOOΠΔ is looking for ‘Infinite possibilities that I have’. ‘Ding Ding Dong’ is a dance pop genre, that features a bass line built on top of a piano leap make LOOΠΔ’s voice more charming. On the lyrics, LOOΠΔ compared ‘Ding Ding Dong’ a sound that it rings through the heart, with an expectation of the one approaching first, with timid characteristic.The lead single ‘365’ is a lyrical R&B ballad, based on the piano, with a message that LOOΠΔ will always shine Orbits around the world, who has been waiting for LOOΠΔ for a long time with moon’s heart.Also, LOOΠΔ’s [#] limited version has CD only songs that will add extra fun.LOOΠΔ discovered destiny in coincidence and fate.#이달의소녀 #LOONA #SoWhat #MV #BlockBerry #BlockBerryCreativeMore about LOOΠΔ/Apple Music : https://music.apple.com/us/album/ep/1497089137?l=ko&ls=1&app=itunesSpotify : https://open.spotify.com/album/6rOL2mghTfDyx5CY0eU1Dn?si=t69PNruEQym2POVzTaW26QAmazon Music: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084HCZLV9/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_awdb_t1_x_UWipEb665S311LOOΠΔ Official : http://www.loonatheworld.comLOOΠΔ Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Twitter : https://twitter.com/loonatheworldLOOΠΔ Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Official Korean Fan Cafe : http://cafe.daum.net/loonatheworldCopyrights 2020 ⓒ BlockBerryCreative.

By comparison, he added, just $18 million was spent on preparedness in Congo’s neighbor Uganda before the virus crossed the border.“This must be a lesson for the rest of the world,” he said.The plea from WHO’s top official comes as the deadly coronavirus has now killed at least 362 people and sickened more than 17,400 worldwide, including patients in the U.S. and Europe.The respiratory illness, which is capable of spreading through human-to-human contact, is not yet considered a pandemic. A pandemic is “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people,” according to WHO. While the new virus has spread to almost two dozen countries, the majority of the cases remain in mainland China.Nevertheless, many global health experts expect the virus will become a pandemic. Since emerging about a month ago in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus has infected more people than the 2003 SARS epidemic, which sickened roughly 8,100 people across the globe over nine months. As of Monday, there are nearly 200 cases in at least 23 countries, outside of China, a handful of which have been transmitted from human contact within those countries.On Thursday, WHO declared the virus a global health emergency after declining to do so at two previous meetings.Tedros said the “continued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China” were “most deeply disturbing.”For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Summer 2020 is the time for F9, the ninth chapter in the saga that has endured for almost two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they’ve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, next year’s The Suicide Squad). F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe—from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tblisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom’s past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent.  www.thefastsaga.com"
