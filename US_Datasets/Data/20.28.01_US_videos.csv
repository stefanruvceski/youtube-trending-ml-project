However, as the city, located in central China's Hubei Province, is now hosting the vast majority of the confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, medical staff across hospitals in Wuhan have faced up to their responsibilities regardless of the risks and sacrifices.On the early morning of Saturday, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the country's grandest traditional festival that was supposed to be filled with fun activities and events, doctors and nurses from the Jinyintan Hospital did not even have time to take a rest.Ding Na is a nurse working in the ICU of the hospital, one that has been at the frontier of the battle for nearly a month since it took in the first infected patient on Dec 29 last year.Her husband is a physician who works on a different floor in the same building. However, over the past 28 days, they did not quite have any chance to meet each other nor much time to rest at home.This has lead to the husband's locker becoming a mail box for the couple to keep in touch and care for each other.I come here every day to bring him tidy clothes here and take away the dirty ones home, as she told the China Central Television (CCTV) reporter.Knowing well about the threat they faced in the fight against the virus better than anyone, the medical workers have still chosen to stick to their duties and try their best to free the patients away from the pain.I hope with our efforts, we are able to control the epidemic at an earlier date so that none of our families, colleagues, friends and fellow citizens suffer anymore, said Guo Wei, deputy head of infection division from Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Today I am doing a 24 hour challenge AGAIN. BUT, this time, I wanted to make it a little more interesting. I am not too big on challenges on my channel, just because I can't compete with the extreme challenges that so many other youtubers are willing to do LOL. I just like painting on things üòÇ PLUS, I feel like a lot of challenges these days have gotten really pointless. But, this one is good haha. I decided to try  to paint and decorate different things for 24 hours. I have a lot of art supplies laying around my art room, just begging to be painted. But I don't often have the time to paint that much at a time. So this was a great opportunity to put a bunch of it to good use finally.I am going to be painting on a seashell, painting a pencil pouch, painting a rock, painting a squishy (mini squishy makeover lol), making a custom mug, decorating a giant clothes pin and a surprise weird item LOL.

But the individual feud between those two wasn't just a battle within that war. It was personal. It was beef.Starting with his trade to the Pistons in the early 1980s, Laimbeer built a reputation as not just a strong rebounder and scorer, but a relentless pest. On one hand, he'd make dirty and dangerous plays, then act like nothing had happened. On the other hand, he'd flop and whine to bait the referees into calling fouls on his opponents. Nobody despised Laimbeer for this quite as much as Bird did. Bird's public campaign against Laimbeer's style of play dated back to the Celtics-Pistons playoff series in 1985, and really took off after Laimbeer started a brawl by fouling Bird hard in the 1987 playoffs. Bird accused Laimbeer of intentionally trying to injure him, and never withdrew the accusation. Even decades later, these two NBA legends maintain an icy distance because of how things played out on the court. This beef might never end, so in this episode, we learn about what built it.Written and produced by Seth RosenthalDirected and edited by Jiazhen ZhangSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com"

What are the plans in place to act against a major threat?  The World Health Organization has said it's too early to term the outbreak of coronavirus an international public health emergency. It also doesn't fulfil the criteria for a pandemic, which is a spread worldwide of a new disease. Ben Chu reports, and Katie speaks to Tom Inglesby, Director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Sarah Gilbert, Professor of Vaccinology at Oxford University.Newsnight is the BBC's flagship news and current affairs TV programme - with analysis, debate, exclusives, and robust interviews. Website: https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsnightTwitter: https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnightFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsnight"

Does more expensive mean more better? We‚Äôre gonna find out once and for all.Donut bought two identical Nissan 350z‚Äôs, and for the past few weeks have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track.Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) got a bunch of really cheap parts and in the end got  a slammed turbo z that shoots flames all for around $13,000.Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) on the other hand, got a bunch of really nice expensive stuff totaling an astounding $33,000.  Then we tested them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We‚Äôre gonna break down the cost of building these two cars, test them head to head on track, and decide which is better. Low Car got a set of eBay coilovers of unknown origin,  and Hi Car was treated to a set of KW V3s. Next, we installed wheels and tires. Hi Car got some sick Advan RGIII‚Äôs wrapped in Bridgestone RE71s. Meanwhile on the Low Car, We bought some XXR 527s, and decided to run Federal RS-RR tires. In the end, both cars were able to achieve supercar-level braking distance by switching to super sticky rubber. Nolan and Aaron installed more aggressive brake pads, steel braided brake lines, flushed and replaced the brake fluid, and bled the lines. Over on Hi Car, Zach and James replaced the car‚Äôs entire braking system with a 6 piston, 13 brake kit from Wilwood. After that we went inside our Zs, installing racing seats. The Hi Car got two Sparco QRT-R seats, a Greddy steering wheel, and a hub to make it removable. Lo Car received some Corbeau DFXs racing seats.Next, both cars were fitted with modified differentials to make sick skids easier. Hi Car got a very trick Kaaz 2-way differential. Zach spent a lot of time adjusting the spacing, making sure it was perfect. Over on Lo Car we took a different route. Instead of installing a new differential, we welded ours together!After making a bunch of performance upgrades, it was time to alter the looks of our beloved Zs. Team Low decided to give Lo Car some plastidip.Over on team Hi, they took their car to a professional vinyl shop.Finally, we gave the Donut Zs some BOOST! Hi car got a Jim Wolf  twin turbo setup that made it sound like a Baby GTR. And the low car got a single turbo kit by way of eBay.Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!‚ñ∫Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

This test, which does not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, is intended to demonstrate Crew Dragon‚Äôs ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. The six-hour test window opens at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC. A backup opportunity with the same six-hour launch window opening at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC, is available on Monday, January 20. Current weather data suggests our best opportunity for the launch escape test will be towards the end of the four-hour window, but we will continue to provide updates as new data becomes available."

In this video, I‚Äôm going to show you six exercises for your chest that you can use as a stand alone chest workout that will take just about ten minutes to complete. You will be working hard. We are going to trade in workout length and junk volume for intensity and effort.To start, you will ideally have access to a dual cable machine. If you do not and are doing this chest workout at home, you can easily substitute these out for resistance bands. The key is that the cables or bands provide an element of resisted adduction which is not found when simply using dumbbells and a bench. You want to choose a weight that you will reach failure in at the 8-10 rep mark. With only transition rest, stand up and adjust the cables up (or the bands) so that you can perform the next chest exercise in this workout; cable crossovers. Here you want to choose a 10-12 rep max and work each arm to failure. Don‚Äôt worry if you find that due to the fatigue you are only able to get out 8 or 9 reps. The key is that the drop sets are set up in such a way that it is meant to accommodate your fatigue and allow you to do some work where you wouldn‚Äôt previously be able to do any.Finally, the third exercise in this first circuit is the pushup. When doing these, you want to once again rep out until failure. The idea here is to not just push your body away from the ground but to think of it as squeezing yourself off the ground. This will engage more of the chest and work on recruiting more chest fibers as you incorporate an element of resisted adduction.This whole first drop set should take you somewhere around two and a half minutes to complete.Next, move immediately over to the second chest workout circuit.This one starts with a pair of dumbbells and the floor press exercise. Again, the weight used here should be something that challenges you and causes you to reach failure in the 8-10 rep range. Go to failure on this exercise and then pick up one of the dumbbells for the second adduction focused exercise of the workout; the Cavaliere Crossover.Perform 12 reps on each arm and then head over to the dip station for the final exercise in the workout. If you don‚Äôt have access to a dip station you can easily perform this at home in the corner of a kitchen counter. Do your dips until you reach failure and your second circuit is done. Once again, this entire circuit should take you about two and a half minutes with the entire workout clocking in around 5 minutes to this point.From here, head back to the original circuit and perform it for a second round. Do the same for the second circuit as well. If you have to adjust the weights down slightly to accommodate the mounting fatigue you may do so. Keep in mind, the most important thing you can do is keep the effort level high and take your sets to failure.At the end, you should be done in about 10-12 minutes tops. You do have the option to to through this one more round for a total of 18 high effort sets and a workout time that will barely surpass 15 minutes. The key to the effectiveness of this chest workout is that it is condensing the amount of work being done by the muscles into a shorter period of time. This type of workload can have a stimulatory effect on the muscle and lead to muscle hypertrophy through multiple mechanisms, one of which being a metabolic training benefit.Try this out and let me know how you like it.
