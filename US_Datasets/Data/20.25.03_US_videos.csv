More than 15-thousand cases have been confirmed in New York, and around 200 deaths. It's been in lockdown since Sunday, and state officials are pleading for help, but preparing for the worst.US lawmakers have agreed a 2 Trillion dollar stimulus package. After days of wrangling, Democrats and Republicans announced the deal shortly after midnight in Washington. Among the items agreed - adults can receive direct deposits of up to 1,200 dollars - 500 dollars for children. The government will support small businesses with loans to the tune of 367-Bbillion dollars. Hospitals will also get some 150-Bbillion dollars in aid. There will also be half a Ttrillion dollars in guaranteed, subsidised loans to larger industries. Meanwhile China's Hubei province sees the lifting of travel restrictions, where the coronavirus pandemic began in December. Trains are running again, although they're not yet carrying many passengers. Stations are opening up across the province, except in the city of Wuhan, where the corionavirus was first detected. Car drivers there are still being tested, and it will be another two weeks before Wuhan sees its restrictions lifted. It's not only in Hubei where people are now free to go out and about. One family in Beijing is relishing the freedom to roam after weeks cooped up in their apartment.

But he‚Äôs also a pragmatist.‚ÄúThe reality is also that in the coming period a large part of the population will be infected with the virus, he added.So unlike the Italians or the French, the Dutch are not on lockdown. Schools and restaurants have been told to close, but strict social distancing hasn‚Äôt been imposed. People are still hanging out in parks. Even the coffee shops that sell weed are open, though now only for to-go orders.The owner of one coffee shop in Tilburg, who goes by his nickname Meuk, told VICE News that in times like these, establishments like his are vital because they help people keep calm.

Click here: https://www.npr.org/tinydeskFollow NPR Music:Twitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusicInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusicMarch 16, 2020 | Lyndsey McKenna and Marissa Lorusso -- Like many who have graced the Tiny Desk before him, the awkwardness of performing in a working office wasn't lost on Harry Styles. It just feels like you're in the way, he joked. But when you watch his set from behind Bob Boilen's desk, you'd never suspect any discomfort.Backed by his touring band, Styles performed several songs from his latest solo album, Fine Line. Between tracks, he talked about the process of writing these songs: From the day off in Nashville that led to Watermelon Sugar, to the feeling of lovesickness he tried to capture in Adore You. The camaraderie between the band was clear; and Styles was in on the joy, twirling in his seat between verses.Styles might not necessarily be the first name that comes to mind when you think of public radio's only working, desk-music-discovery platform. After all, he's got a wildly devoted fanbase that's followed his every move since his One Direction days. In fact, before soundcheck had even started, a crowd of fans had begun to gather outside NPR HQ. They rightly suspected he would be playing a Tiny Desk concert after word got out that the former One Directioner was spotted in D.C. with no tour date on his public schedule.But beyond the headlines, Styles has proven to be an artist who takes his songcraft and aesthetic seriously, interested in subverting expectations of what a pop star can and should sound like in 2020. That sense of unpretentious creativity is exactly what he brought to his Tiny Desk performance ‚Äì and it definitely earned him some new adoring public radio fans in the process.I have to come into NPR more often, Styles said after he and his band played their first song. It's nice here.We ‚Äî and our massive crowd of colleagues ‚Äî couldn't agree more.SET LISTCherryWatermelon SugarTo Be So LonelyAdore YouMUSICIANSHarry Styles: vocals, guitar; Sarah Jones: drums, vocals; Mitch Rowland: guitar; Adam Prendergast: bass, vocals; Ny Oh: guitar, vocals; Charlotte Clark: piano, Wurlitzer, guitar, vocalsCREDITSProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Kara Frame, CJ Riculan, Melany Rochester, Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Max Posner/NPR"

Use ribbon or fabric ties 18‚Äù-20‚Äù in length. For fabric ties: use a strip 1‚Äùx 18-20‚Äù. Fold one short end 1/4‚Äù in and sew. Next fold the fabric strip long edges in so they meet in the center then fold in half length again. Sew down the open edge to secure. Place the tie with the raw edge next to the corners of the mask just like the elastic was. Tip: Make sure not to sew over the loose end of the tie as you sew around the mask. OPTIONAL: To make the nose are a fit better you can sew a wire ribbon, pipe cleaner, or baggie tie to the lining piece before sewing all three layers together and it would work nicely :)*** Please wash thoroughly after each use! **** Use tightly woven fabric, or hospital grade material.* Keep in mind men and women will be wearing the masks when choosing fabric for mask that will be donated.* Contact local health facilities to see if they are in need of donations. Currently, the supply of surgical masks is at a critical all-time low throughout the entire nation. As a community of sewists, this is a great way we can band together and make a huge difference in this time of need! While handmade fabric face masks are NOT a substitution for N95 masks, in times of emergency, the CDC may allow handmade fabric masks to be used when critical shortages take place. You can read more from the CDC here on the use of homemade masks here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.htmlAccording to the CDC website homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face. In addition to helping medical staff during critical shortages, these masks can be used at home as well. While wearing homemade face masks will not prevent against catching a respiratory illness, they can help reduce the spread of large particles when someone sneezes or coughs. *** PRODUCTS USED **** Fabric: Bonnie and Camille* Juki TL2000 Qi: https://amzn.to/2MYdOZu* Aurifil 50wt Thread: https://amzn.to/33gN1Af* Oliso Pro Smart Iron: https://amzn.to/2ZbppJE* Scissors: https://amzn.to/2tvesWm* Wonder Clips: https://amzn.to/2tr1s4e*** QUILT on the Wall Behind me ***Vintage Spring Quilt Pattern: http://bit.ly/2IMAGw2**** Shop ERICA'S SEWING FAVORITES Here! **** https://www.amazon.com/shop/ericaarndt****  FIND ME HERE **** Email me: erica@confessionsofahomeschooler.comeCourses: http://go.confessionsofahomeschooler.comWebsite: http://www.confessionsofahomeschooler.comStore: http://store.confessionsofahomeschooler.com/COAH Homeschool Community: https://community.confessionsofahomeschooler.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ericaarndt/ YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/EricasHomeschoolFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConfessionsofaHomeschoolerTwitter: http://twitter.com/ericahomeschoolPinterest: http://pinterest.com/ericahomeschoolRavelry: https://www.ravelry.com/people/EricaArndt****  ****  **** Disclosure: This is not a sponsored video.

They have a sort of a big brother-little brother relationship. Not in the sense that Shaq looked out for JaVale or anything like that, no certainly not. More in the sense of... Shaq teased JaVale until it became a real fight so vicious Mom had to step in.

Given the current and evolving situation involving COVID-19, please continue to practice social distancing, stay informed about and comply with local guidelines, and we look forward to working out together someday soon. Kevin Hart wants to motivate an entire city to get healthy, so with the help of David Dobrik, they put out a call for over 1,000 fans to meet up for a community fitness event. The third season of What The Fit starring Kevin Hart follows Kevin and a new squad of famous friends as they continue to inspire the world to work out. They‚Äôll take on the courts of the Harlem Globetrotters, organize a community workout for the entire city, and keep in step with a high school marching band. How much success they‚Äôll have with any of these things is up for debate, but one thing they‚Äôve proved time and time again, is that nothing is too bold, too outrageous or too ridiculous for Kevin and his guests if it can get the world on its feet.FOLLOW THE FUNNY:Facebook‚ñ∂ http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-FBTwitter‚ñ∂ http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-TWInstagram‚ñ∂ http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-IGYouTube‚ñ∂ https://www.youtube.com/user/HartBeatProductionsSnapchat‚ñ∂ LOLNetworkOfficial Website‚ñ∂ http://www.laughoutloud.com Laugh Out Loud is a comedy brand and multi-platform network founded by the world‚Äôs top comedian Kevin Hart.
