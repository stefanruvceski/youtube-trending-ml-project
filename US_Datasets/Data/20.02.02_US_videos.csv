Summer 2020 is the time for F9, the ninth chapter in the saga that has endured for almost two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they’ve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, next year’s The Suicide Squad). F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe—from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tblisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom’s past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent.  www.thefastsaga.com"

Which movie's sins should we expose next?!Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CinemaSins Podcast: https://soundcloud.com/cinemasins TVSins: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe4bOvc1mYxFcQ5xPb9Zmow MusicVideoSins: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBq8oBRVTsMpjWiHfjJpDw Twitters...Jeremy: http://twitter.com/cinemasins Barrett: http://twitter.com/musicvideosins Aaron: http://twitter.com/aarondicer Jonathan: http://twitter.com/samloomis13 Denee: http://twitter.com/deneesaysMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/cinemasins-storeSubreddit: http://reddit.com/r/cinemasins Website: http://cinemasins.com SinCast Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/SinCastCinemaSins#CinemaSins#EverythingWrongWith#Joker"

While on a forgettable first date together in Ohio, a black man (Get Out’s Daniel Kaluuya) and a black woman (Jodie Turner-Smith, in her first starring feature-film role), are pulled over for a minor traffic infraction. The situation escalates, with sudden and tragic results, when the man kills the police officer in self-defense. Terrified and in fear for their lives, the man, a retail employee, and the woman, a criminal defense lawyer, are forced to go on the run. But the incident is captured on video and goes viral, and the couple unwittingly become a symbol of trauma, terror, grief and pain for people across the country. As they drive, these two unlikely fugitives will discover themselves and each other in the most dire and desperate of circumstances, and will forge a deep and powerful love that will reveal their shared humanity and shape the rest of their lives. Joining a legacy of films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Thelma & Louise, Queen & Slim is a powerful, consciousness-raising love story that confronts the staggering human toll of racism and the life-shattering price of violence. Waithe wrote the script based on an original idea by bestselling author James Frey (A Million Little Pieces, Katerina). The feature-film directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas (executive producer of HBO’s Insecure) stars Academy Award® nominee Daniel Kaluuya as “Slim” and rising star Jodie Turner-Smith (Syfy’s Nightflyers), as “Queen.” Waithe produces the film via her company, Hillman Grad Productions, along with Matsoukas via her production company, De La Revolución Films. Frey produces via his production company, 3BlackDot, alongside Andrew Coles and Michelle Knudsen.

I love anything vocal/singing related and geek out on it every day.  I want to motivate and inspire others to follow their dreams…corny? Well maybe but it’s true. So what’s motivating me?? I had a huge tumour removed summer 2017 and my ovaries and fallopian tubes. The tumour was the size of a 20 week baby!!  However, despite not being able to walk for a couple of weeks, and feeling generally awful…. It has made me create and do what I love! It wasn’t an easy time but I won’t let fear dictate my life. I didn’t think ‘why me’, there are plenty of horrific issues people have to deal with…it’s not always smooth sailing.  It’s true when you hear, ‘Life is short’, the crazy thing is, I am glad it happened…I appreciate life even more and practice gratitude everyday…It’s so easy to get caught up with the little things…and I do sometimes, but look at the bigger picture, will it matter in a year or two…? Also thank you for all your support. It means a lot. Subscribe to Rebecca Vocal Athlete to get inspired by new videos!Have a great day!!Rebecca Xx"

However, as the city, located in central China's Hubei Province, is now hosting the vast majority of the confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, medical staff across hospitals in Wuhan have faced up to their responsibilities regardless of the risks and sacrifices.On the early morning of Saturday, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the country's grandest traditional festival that was supposed to be filled with fun activities and events, doctors and nurses from the Jinyintan Hospital did not even have time to take a rest.Ding Na is a nurse working in the ICU of the hospital, one that has been at the frontier of the battle for nearly a month since it took in the first infected patient on Dec 29 last year.Her husband is a physician who works on a different floor in the same building. However, over the past 28 days, they did not quite have any chance to meet each other nor much time to rest at home.This has lead to the husband's locker becoming a mail box for the couple to keep in touch and care for each other.I come here every day to bring him tidy clothes here and take away the dirty ones home, as she told the China Central Television (CCTV) reporter.Knowing well about the threat they faced in the fight against the virus better than anyone, the medical workers have still chosen to stick to their duties and try their best to free the patients away from the pain.I hope with our efforts, we are able to control the epidemic at an earlier date so that none of our families, colleagues, friends and fellow citizens suffer anymore, said Guo Wei, deputy head of infection division from Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Today I am doing a 24 hour challenge AGAIN. BUT, this time, I wanted to make it a little more interesting. I am not too big on challenges on my channel, just because I can't compete with the extreme challenges that so many other youtubers are willing to do LOL. I just like painting on things 😂 PLUS, I feel like a lot of challenges these days have gotten really pointless. But, this one is good haha. I decided to try  to paint and decorate different things for 24 hours. I have a lot of art supplies laying around my art room, just begging to be painted. But I don't often have the time to paint that much at a time. So this was a great opportunity to put a bunch of it to good use finally.I am going to be painting on a seashell, painting a pencil pouch, painting a rock, painting a squishy (mini squishy makeover lol), making a custom mug, decorating a giant clothes pin and a surprise weird item LOL. This video almost turned out like a tiktok painting compilation haha.

But the individual feud between those two wasn't just a battle within that war. It was personal. It was beef.Starting with his trade to the Pistons in the early 1980s, Laimbeer built a reputation as not just a strong rebounder and scorer, but a relentless pest. On one hand, he'd make dirty and dangerous plays, then act like nothing had happened. On the other hand, he'd flop and whine to bait the referees into calling fouls on his opponents. Nobody despised Laimbeer for this quite as much as Bird did. Bird's public campaign against Laimbeer's style of play dated back to the Celtics-Pistons playoff series in 1985, and really took off after Laimbeer started a brawl by fouling Bird hard in the 1987 playoffs. Bird accused Laimbeer of intentionally trying to injure him, and never withdrew the accusation. Even decades later, these two NBA legends maintain an icy distance because of how things played out on the court. This beef might never end, so in this episode, we learn about what built it.Written and produced by Seth RosenthalDirected and edited by Jiazhen ZhangSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com"

Subscribe to our channel here: https://goo.gl/31Q53FCases of Coronavirus have now been confirmed in Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, the US and France, after the virus began in China. In a globalised world, how might such an outbreak be contained?We’ve had similar scares before, with SARS in 2003, bird flu in 2006, swine flu in 2009, and even Ebola and Zika.

It also doesn't fulfil the criteria for a pandemic, which is a spread worldwide of a new disease.
