Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. This led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   But the big picture conceals  the details. Let us look at one region in particular: Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. So is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?

At the intersection of it all is the likeable, magnetic bodega owner Usnavi (Anthony Ramos), who saves every penny from his daily grind as he hopes, imagines and sings about a better life.  ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù fuses Lin-Manuel Miranda‚Äôs kinetic music and lyrics with director Jon M. Chu‚Äôs lively and authentic eye for storytelling to capture a world very much of its place, but universal in its experience. ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù stars Anthony Ramos (‚ÄúA Star is Born,‚Äù Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù), Corey Hawkins (‚ÄúStraight Outta Compton,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlacKkKlansman‚Äù), singer/songwriter Leslie Grace, Melissa Barrera (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúVida‚Äù), Olga Merediz (Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù), Daphne Rubin-Vega (Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúRent‚Äù), Gregory Diaz IV (Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúMatilda the Musical‚Äù), Stephanie Beatriz (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrooklyn Nine-Nine‚Äù), Dascha Polanco (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúOrange is the New Black‚Äù) and Jimmy Smits (the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù films). Chu is directing the film from a screenplay by Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes; it is based on the musical stage play, with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, book by Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes and concept by Miranda. ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù is produced by Miranda and Hudes, together with Scott Sanders, Anthony Bregman and Mara Jacobs. David Nicksay and Kevin McCormick served as executive producers. Behind the camera, Chu is reuniting with his ‚ÄúCrazy Rich Asians‚Äù production designer, Nelson Coates, and editor, Myron Kerstein. He is also collaborating with director of photography Alice Brooks (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù) and costume designer Mitchell Travers (‚ÄúEighth Grade‚Äù).  The choreography is by Christopher Scott, who previously teamed with Chu on the award-winning ‚ÄúThe Legion of Extraordinary Dancers.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù was filmed in New York, primarily on location in the dynamic community of Washington Heights.  Slated for release on June 26, 2020, it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures."

When Aliyah was 15 years old, she moved in with her mother after her father passed away. It was so difficult for her to deal with her loss, and to make things even more stressful, Aliyah had to go to a brand new school after her move. On her first day, she was so scared to start her new high school and meet new people. She was really shy. But one day, she met a boy named Aaron. Aaron knew Aliyah's mom through his job, so they immediately had a connection. They became really good friends, and they eventually started dating. They got really close, and Aliyah ended up falling deeply in love with him. He was her first boyfriend and real relationship. One day, when Aaron and Aliyah were home alone, after watching anime, playing video games and hanging out, they decided to take their relationship to the next level. They went to her room, and one thing led to another.  A few weeks later, Aliyah was with her best friend when she started to feel a pain in her stomach. When she went to the bathroom, she realized that she was experiencing a pregnancy symptom. She immediately got really nervous, so she called Aaron and he brought her a pregnancy test. Aliyah took the test a few times, and she became even more nervous and confused when the results were both positive and negative. She didn't know if she was pregnant. Aliyah went to the doctor with her mom to get an official test. After waiting nervously, Aliyah finally got the results - she was not pregnant. Even though she had mixed emotions at first, Aliyah decided that everything ultimately worked out for the best. She did not feel ready to have a baby and become a mother at the time. When she looks back, she probably says to herself, My pregnancy scare was a moment I'll never forget.
