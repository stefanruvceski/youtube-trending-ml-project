You’re not alone — most people picture the same thing. But we’re all wrong. Ancient buildings and sculptures were actually really colorful. The Greeks and Romans painted their statues to resemble real bodies, and often gilded them so they shone like gods. So why is seemingly every museum on planet earth full of white marble sculptures? It’s partly an honest mistake. After the fall of Rome, ancient sculptures were buried or left out in the open air for hundreds of years. By the time the Renaissance began in the 1300s, their paint had faded away. As a result, the artists unearthing, and copying ancient art didn’t realize how colorful it was supposed to be.But white marble couldn’t have become the norm without some willful ignorance. Even though there was a bunch of evidence that ancient sculpture was painted, artists, art historians and the general public chose to disregard it. Western culture seemed to collectively accept that white marble was simply prettier. Today, art history is more concerned with accuracy than it is with what might look better. So teams of researchers use a combination of art and science to painstakingly create reconstructions of ancient statues, showing us the true colors of classical antiquity.Most of the reconstruction work shown in this video was done by the Polychromy Research Project, led by conservationists Vinzenz Brinkmann and Ulrike Koch-Brinkmann. To see more of their work you can buy their book, “Gods in Color: Polychromy in the Ancient World” https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/570229/gods-in-color-by-vinzenz-brinkmann/9783791357072 Also check out:“The Myth of Whiteness in Classical Sculpture” by Margaret Talbothttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/the-myth-of-whiteness-in-classical-sculpture And the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art Historyhttps://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/prms/hd_prms.htm Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn’t do much about it.Unless… we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, Имяя Фамилияя, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, Máté Szabó, Kasper Kylmälä, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

The natural beauty, the friendliness of the people, and the amazingly flavorful food, is what makes Kerala so special. Thanks to Ebbin from Food N Travel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wTAWLHOWLYyZI9m_JV8zg) who took us on an ultimate food tour of Kerala. Can’t wait to share all of the videos with you.Kannur - We started in the North of Kerala, the Malabar Coast on the Arabian Sea. Kannur, is a friendly town, laid back, and there’s plenty of amazing street food to try.Onakkan Bharathi (Puttu Restaurant, Kannur) - We started this Indian street food tour with puttu, mutton curry, and a variety of lentils and chickpeas for breakfast. The combination was fantastic, perfect harmony of spice and flavor. The heat mostly came from black pepper. Total price - 286 INR ($4.03)Kerala crunchy snacks - Thanks to Roshan from Seashell Haris Beach Home in Kannur, for taking us to eat local snacks all drenched in chutney. I wasn’t all that excited at first for snacks in glass jugs - but the chutney blew me away. Unbelievable flavors coming out of that chutney and pickled snacks. 10 INR ($0.14) - Price per bowlStreet Mussels - Next up on this Kerala street food tour, we went to an afternoon snack stall specializing in mainly hot masala mussels, which were formed into dumpling like shapes, and fried in hot coconut oil. They were superb, as were everything else. 200 INR ($2.81) - Price for everythingChili Soda - Finally to end this food tour of Kannur, we had a soothing chili and coriander soda - they put pickled chillies and coriander in pineapple juice in a soda. It’s amazing.Friends in the video:Ebbin: https://www.instagram.com/foodntraveltv/Roshan: https://www.instagram.com/seashellharisbeachhome/Joel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/🎵MUSIC: https://www.audionetwork.com/——————————————————🍌Banana Chips are available now worldwide!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/📷Camera gear I use:https://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

I'm back with another episode of squishy makeovers. This is a good one! I made some creations, I'm really proud of, I hope you guys like them just as much as I do.Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity. It’s not a “whodunit,” it’s a “whosungit!”Preview: Season Three Is About To Be Lit | Season 3 | THE MASKED SINGERhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MaskedSingerFOX#TheMaskedSinger"

De nuevo los porteros fueron protagonistas evitando la caída de sus vallas, mientras que los experimentados Sergio Ramos y Gerard Piqué realizaron sendas salvadas para evitar un gol en contra de sus equipos. Gol anulado por el VAR a Bale por fuera de juego y un par de jugadas que generaron un poco de polémica, le dieron el punto exacto a este partido con el que ambos equipos siguen punteros del campeonato.El último Clásico que quedó empatado a ceros fue el 23 de noviembre de 2002 también en el Camp Nou.#beINClasico #ElClasico #RealMadrid #Barcelona Connect with beIN SPORTS Online:Watch us on TV: http://bit.ly/2d7bf5YWatch us Online: http://bit.ly/1WNtvkcVisit our WEBSITE: http://beINSPORTS.comLike us on FACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/beINSPORTSUSAFollow us on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/beINSPORTSUSAFollow us on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/beINSPORTSUSA"
