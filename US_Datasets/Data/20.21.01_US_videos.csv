Spenser (Mark Wahlberg) — an ex-cop better known for making trouble than solving it — just got out of prison and is leaving Boston for good. But first he gets roped into helping his old boxing coach and mentor, Henry (Alan Arkin), with a promising amateur. That's Hawk (Winston Duke), a brash, no-nonsense MMA fighter convinced he'll be a tougher opponent than Spenser ever was. When two of Spenser’s former colleagues turn up murdered, he recruits Hawk and his foul-mouthed ex-girlfriend, Cissy (Iliza Shlesinger), to help him investigate and bring the culprits to justice. From director Peter Berg, SPENSER CONFIDENTIAL is an action-comedy co-starring Bokeem Woodbine, Marc Maron, and Post Malone. Inspired by Robert B.

Bake the french fries at 185 degrees for 5 hours, until fully dehydrated.2. Heat a large pot full of salted water on high. Grind the french fries in a food processor until smooth then use a spoon to push through a strainer to ensure there are no large pieces. 3. In a mixing bowl, stir together the semolina flour and ⅔ cups of ground french fry crumbs. Add half your water and mix with your hands until a shaggy dough forms. Add the rest of the water and knead with your hands for a few minutes until dough is smooth and doesn’t stick to your hands. If the dough is too dry to from a solid ball, knead in a few drops of water. If the dough is too wet and sticks to your hands, knead in a few pinches of semolina flour. Form finished dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and let set in the fridge for at least half an hour.4. Unwrap rested dough then feed it through a Kitchenaid macaroni extruder while cutting off the pasta tubes at ¾ inch intervals. Dust a pan with extra semolina flour to catch the noodles.5. Drop in salted boiling water for 4 minutes and strain to reserve for later.Caramelized OnionsIngredients:- 1 Tbsp butter- 1 whole white onion- 1/2 tsp salt- 1/2 Tbsp sugar1. Melt butter on high in a medium sauce pot then add in onions, sugar, and salt. Stir and continue to cook on medium-high for 15 minutes until a deep caramel color has formed. If the onions start to burn, add in a ¼ cup of water and stir.Thousand IslandIngredients:- 1 cup mayo- 1/2 cup ketchup- 1/4 cup finely chopped dill pickles- 1/2 tsp paprika- 1/4 tsp onion powder- 1/4 tsp garlic powder1. Chop dill pickles as finely as humanly possible then whisk together with mayo, ketchup, chopped pickles paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. You can always substitute relish for dill pickles but it doesn’t have the same bite. Animal-Style Cheese SauceIngredients:- 3 Tbsp butter - 2 ½ Tbsp flour- 16 oz whole milk- 12 slices American cheese- 4 ounces shredded medium cheddar cheese- 1/2 cup Thousand Island1. Melt butter in a small sauce pot on medium then add flour and stir. Cook for about two minutes until a light blonde color is reached. Add in milk, stir, and cook for about two minutes until sauce has visibly thickened. Add American cheese and cheddar and stir until melted. Take off the heat then add in Thousand Island.Finishing the Animal-Style Mac ‘n’ CheeseIngredients:- 1/2 cup vegetable oil- 1 cup finely chopped french fries- Cooked macaroni noodles- Animal-Style cheese sauce- Thousand Island- 4 slices American Cheese- Caramelized onions1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Heat the oil in a sautee pan until it moves freely across the pan then add your chopped french fries and fry until crispy, about 30-45 seconds. Strain and reserve.2. Stir together macaroni noodles and Animal-Style cheese sauce to your desired cheesy noodly levels. Either portion out into individual baking dishes or one larger baking dish.3. Top with crispy french fry bits and bake for 10 minutes, just until piping hot and molten.4. Remove from the oven and immediately top with a slice of american cheese, a hefty smattering of Thousand Island, and Caramelized onions. 5. Eat it, but please wait for it to cool a bit because we don’t need another burnt tongue lawsuit on our hands :("

This test, which does not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, is intended to demonstrate Crew Dragon’s ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. The six-hour test window opens at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC. A backup opportunity with the same six-hour launch window opening at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC, is available on Monday, January 20. Current weather data suggests our best opportunity for the launch escape test will be towards the end of the four-hour window, but we will continue to provide updates as new data becomes available."

In this video, I’m going to show you six exercises for your chest that you can use as a stand alone chest workout that will take just about ten minutes to complete. You will be working hard. We are going to trade in workout length and junk volume for intensity and effort.To start, you will ideally have access to a dual cable machine. If you do not and are doing this chest workout at home, you can easily substitute these out for resistance bands. The key is that the cables or bands provide an element of resisted adduction which is not found when simply using dumbbells and a bench. You want to choose a weight that you will reach failure in at the 8-10 rep mark. With only transition rest, stand up and adjust the cables up (or the bands) so that you can perform the next chest exercise in this workout; cable crossovers. Here you want to choose a 10-12 rep max and work each arm to failure. Don’t worry if you find that due to the fatigue you are only able to get out 8 or 9 reps. The key is that the drop sets are set up in such a way that it is meant to accommodate your fatigue and allow you to do some work where you wouldn’t previously be able to do any.Finally, the third exercise in this first circuit is the pushup. When doing these, you want to once again rep out until failure. The idea here is to not just push your body away from the ground but to think of it as squeezing yourself off the ground. This will engage more of the chest and work on recruiting more chest fibers as you incorporate an element of resisted adduction.This whole first drop set should take you somewhere around two and a half minutes to complete.Next, move immediately over to the second chest workout circuit.This one starts with a pair of dumbbells and the floor press exercise. Again, the weight used here should be something that challenges you and causes you to reach failure in the 8-10 rep range. Go to failure on this exercise and then pick up one of the dumbbells for the second adduction focused exercise of the workout; the Cavaliere Crossover.Perform 12 reps on each arm and then head over to the dip station for the final exercise in the workout. If you don’t have access to a dip station you can easily perform this at home in the corner of a kitchen counter. Do your dips until you reach failure and your second circuit is done. Once again, this entire circuit should take you about two and a half minutes with the entire workout clocking in around 5 minutes to this point.From here, head back to the original circuit and perform it for a second round. Do the same for the second circuit as well. If you have to adjust the weights down slightly to accommodate the mounting fatigue you may do so. Keep in mind, the most important thing you can do is keep the effort level high and take your sets to failure.At the end, you should be done in about 10-12 minutes tops. You do have the option to to through this one more round for a total of 18 high effort sets and a workout time that will barely surpass 15 minutes. The key to the effectiveness of this chest workout is that it is condensing the amount of work being done by the muscles into a shorter period of time. This type of workload can have a stimulatory effect on the muscle and lead to muscle hypertrophy through multiple mechanisms, one of which being a metabolic training benefit.Try this out and let me know how you like it.

For this list, we’re taking a look at why the cinematic version of “Cats” is a shoddily made, borderline incoherent mess of a movie, and why Cats is the worst movie of 2019. We acknowledge that this is destined to become a “so bad, it’s good” cult classic, but that’s clearly not what the filmmakers or studio had intended. From its creepiness, to its annoying songs, to its complete absence of a plot, there are too many reasons to count why Cats is one of the worst movies of the year.

A muscle-car drag race, obviously. And one that features over 2,200 horsepower combined. In this video, we pit these three super muscle cars against one another for quarter-mile bragging rights. Which one is the quickest? Watch to find out. Ford Mustang Shelby GT500The Shelby GT500 is a high-performance version of the Mustang coupe available in a single trim level. Essentially a track-ready, street-legal Mustang, it has many performance features not available on the standard-issue car.When you're the top horse in the stable, expectations are high. And nothing short of world-beating performance is expected of the new Mustang Shelby GT500. Since Ford ended production of the previous-generation GT500, Dodge has normalized pony-car extremes with its Challenger Hellcat variations, and Chevrolet has set new records on the crucible of test tracks, Germany's Nürburgring, with its Camaro ZL1.The Shelby GT500 appears well equipped to reassert itself as the top horse in the stable. Ford developed a new seven-speed dual-clutch transmission specifically for this engine and fitted huge 16.5-inch-diameter front brake rotors clamped upon with six-piston calipers. The adaptive suspension can adjust to various modes, including settings for track-day heroics or drag-race showdowns.Full 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500 Review: https://www.edmunds.com/ford/shelby-gt500/2020/Dodge Challenger Hellcat RedeyeThere aren't a lot of vehicles we consider to be muscle cars. The 2019 Dodge Challenger, with its outlandish horsepower and classic styling, certainly qualifies. Muscle cars are also known for their lack of practicality, but the Challenger bucks that trend by making fewer sacrifices in everyday usability thanks to its large trunk and relatively spacious rear seats.The new 797-hp SRT Hellcat Redeye is basically the retired Demon but with a slightly detuned V8 and less drag-race-specific hardware. There are also some changes in the supporting trims. All-wheel drive is now available on the base SXT, the Widebody treatment is offered on the R/T Scat Pack, and a new dual-snorkel hood increases the Hellcat output by 10 hp. Some trims also come with fewer standard features and corresponding price drops.Even without these latest changes, the Challenger would have remained one of our favorite vehicles in any class. It doesn't have the corner-carving chops of the Camaro or the Mustang, and we're quite fine with that. Not many cars have this kind of sinister style or performance that won't break the bank or overtly compromise your daily drive.The Challenger may not be as quick or as responsive as the Mustang or the Camaro, but it's always a hoot to drive. The Dodge's sheer size makes in-town maneuvering a bit tough (the wide-body fenders don't help), but the meaty tires and upgraded suspension aid handling and body roll.Full 2019 Dodge Challenger Hellcat Redeye Review: https://www.edmunds.com/dodge/challenger/2019/srt-hellcat-redeye/Chevrolet Camaro ZL1The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro has been refreshed, with new fascias, front and rear lights, and some tweaks to trim-level equipment lists. But the only quality-of-life improvement is the upgrade to Chevy's newest and quickest infotainment system, the aptly named Chevrolet Infotainment 3. Nothing that makes the Camaro a tremendous performer and rewarding car to drive has changed, but nothing that makes it an unappealing choice for daily living has changed either.Spend any time behind the wheel of a Camaro, and you'll quickly realize it's sharper and more purposeful than its American muscle-car rivals, especially when equipped with the 1LE package — an assortment of performance upgrades meant to improve handling, steering and braking. For 2019 models, Chevy has expanded the 1LE offering, making it available with all three engine options, including the turbocharged 2.0-liter.In many ways, the Camaro feels like the odd man out in the American muscle-car trinity. The Dodge Challenger has stayed true to form and is basically a rolling couch you can equip with a 797-horsepower V8, while the Ford Mustang has turned into a solid all-arounder with broad appeal for coupe buyers. But the Camaro has become a true sports car with all the ups and downs that entails, essentially abandoning all the traditional muscle-car traits except high-output V8 engines.Full 2019 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Review: https://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/camaro/2019/Subscribe to Edmunds to watch all of the latest videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/Edmundsvideo?sub_confirmation=1#ShelbyGT500 #DodgeChallenger #ChevyCamaro"

One night, he makes the mistake of drunkenly dropping an inflammatory barb on a broadcast of Skizm, an illegal death-match fight club streamed live to the public. In response, Riktor (Ned Dennehy), the maniacal mastermind behind the channel, decides to force Miles' hand (or hands, as it were) and have him join the fun. Miles wakes to find heavy pistols bolted into his bones, and learns Nix (Samara Weaving), the trigger-happy star of Skizm, is his first opponent. Gleefully echoing elements of Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the Purge franchise, and videogames like Mortal Kombat, Guns Akimbo is hilariously dark, viciously violent, and potentially — chillingly — prescient. Director Jason Lei Howden (Deathgasm) foretells of a future that may soon await us: drone-captured live feeds, UFC-like competitions pushed to an extreme, and online streaming platforms used for gladiatorial entertainment all around the world. As Miles navigates the underworld of Skizm, the stakes — and the ratings — have never been higher. #GunsAkimbo #DanielRadcliffe #SamaraWeavingIn Cinemas March 5th 2020Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/madmanfilmsTwitter: http://twitter.com/madmanfilms Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/madmanfilms"

Fourteen-year-old Mouse (Jahi Di’Allo Winston) desperately wants to join the Midnight Clique, an infamous group of Baltimore dirt-bike riders who rule the summertime streets. His older brother, Stro, was their top rider before his tragic death—a loss that consumes Mouse as much as his passion for bikes. Mouse’s mom (Teyonah Parris) and his police mentor, Detective Rivers (William Catlett), work overtime to help the charismatic teen reach his full potential, but when the Midnight Clique’s leader, Blax (Meek Mill), takes the boy under his wing, the lure of revving his own dirt bike skids Mouse toward a road way past the straight and narrow.Puerto Rican director Angel Manuel Soto (Dinner Party, 2018 New Frontier VR experience at Sundance Film Festival) returns to the Festival with this electric feature that pulses with teen gusto, thumping hip-hop, and amazing bike tricks. Soto directs an astonishingly talented cast to create a narrative bursting with pitch-perfect performances and intoxicating emotion. Based on the documentary 12 O’Clock Boys, Charm City Kings is one boy’s unforgettable journey toward manhood.Subscribe for more official content from Meek Mill:https://MeekMill.lnk.to/subscribeFollow Meek Millhttp://meekMill.comhttp://twitter.com/MeekMillhttp://facebook.com/MeekMillhttp://instagram.com/MeekMillhttps://soundcloud.com/meek-mill-dc"

When a grisly murder shocks the city, Detective Tiago Vega (Daniel Zovatto) and his partner Lewis Michener (Nathan Lane) become embroiled in an epic story that reflects the rich history of Los Angeles: from the building of the city's first freeways and its deep traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism. Before long, Tiago and his family are grappling with powerful forces that threaten to tear them apart. Penny Dreadful: City of Angels will premiere on Sunday, April 26 at 10/9c only on SHOWTIME.#PennyDreadful #CityOfAngelsDon’t have SHOWTIME?
