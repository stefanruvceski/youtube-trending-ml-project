This Is What Happened To Her Brain. ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/QiBpKuTrFrwThis is a case of beer potomania, which is a very specific case of hypotonic hyponatremia. Humans need solute in order to produce urine. These solutes are predominantly sodium, potassium and urea, along with others. Beer contains little to no sodium or potassium. Drinking only 50 beers daily for weeks causes solute loss, on top of vitamin deficiency and poor nutrition.Slowly as sodium is depleted, more volume from beer is accumulated in the body.Beer contains water, alcohol and carbohydrates, the latter which induces an insulin response in the body to prevent muscle catabolism.Muscle catabolism could count as protein that would produce urea, but because of insulin response, it doesn't happen, further exacerbating solute loss.The accumulation of water in the body and depletion of solute leads to chronic hyponatremia. This is because the kidneys need solute exchange in the process of urine production. If these solutes are absent, minimal urine is produced, and the urine that is produced is maximally dilute (eg low specific gravity) Neurologic sequelae from low sodium presence in blood include seizures and is an emergency.In this patient, it wasn't clear whether he was suffering withdrawal syndrome, chronic hyponatremia, or both. In the case as it happened, the hospital ran out of medicines for the SE because it was so frequent, and needed to borrow twice from neighboring hospitals.Osmotic demyelination syndrome appears to have a higher risk in patients who have more electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic derangements. Please see references for more information.These cases are patients who I, or my colleagues have seen. They are de-identified and many instances have been presented in more depth in an academic setting. These videos are not individual medical advice and are for general educational purposes only.

Add the water and 1 tablespoon of olive oil and continue to mix with a fork until a dough forms. 2) Lightly flour a cutting board or clean counter surface and turn the dough out. Use your hands to knead the dough for 5 minutes. If the dough is too wet and sticks to your hands, add more flour. 3) Use the remaining olive oil to grease the bottom of a mixing bowl. Add the dough to the bowl then wrap in plastic, OR COVER THE BOWL WITH YOUR MYTHICAL KITCHEN TOWEL ;-), and let set out at room temp for at least two hours (make your sauce during this time!). Either use immediately or throw in the fridge for up to 3 days. Step 2: SauceIngredients:* 1/2 cup peanut butter* 1 cup chicken stock* 1 Tbsp canola oil* ‚Öì cup chopped onion * 2 minced garlic cloves * 2 Tbsp tomato paste* ¬Ω tsp salt* ¬º tsp chili flake* ¬º tsp dried thyme* ¬Ω tsp Maggi seasoning (substitute soy sauce if you can‚Äôt find it)1) Warm chicken stock in a small sauce pot and add peanut butter. Whisk together until combined.2) Heat oil in an additional medium sauce pot on medium-high and add onions, garlic, chili flake, salt, tomato paste, and dried thyme and sautee for 10 minutes until vegetables are softened. Add in your peanut butter and stock mixture and whisk, then add Maggi seasoning (or, to reiterate, soy sauce).Step 3: Top and BakeIngredients:* 2/3 cup grape jelly* ¬º cup red wine vinegar* ¬Ω fresh habanero pepper* 15 or so grapes, sliced in half * 1 portion pizza dough* ¬Ω tsp olive oil* 1 portion sauce * 10-ish pepperoni slices* 1 block low-moisture mozzarella1) Preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Heat a small sauce pot on medium high. Add red wine vinegar and jelly to the pot and whisk until the jelly is melted and smooth. Add the habanero and allow it to steep.2) Drop in your grapes and poach for about 15 minutes, or until the grapes are soft and infused with the jelly. 3) Flour a surface and use your hands to press the pizza dough into a round. Grab the edges of the pizza dough and quickly turn your hands around the edges to form a sturdy crust and a thin center. Use a rolling pin to create it if you need to! There‚Äôs no shame in that game!4) Oil the bottom of a round pizza pan then stretch your dough over the top until the crusts fit the edges of the pan. Oil the crust as well. 5) Spread a layer of the peanut butter sauce over top of the dough, then add cheese, pepperoni, and bake for about 10 minutes until the crust gets nicely browned. 6) Remove the pizza and top with poached grapes as well as some of that sweet spicy grape jelly syrup. Slice and enjoy‚Äîassuming you‚Äôre into that type of thing."

By comparison, he added, just $18 million was spent on preparedness in Congo‚Äôs neighbor Uganda before the virus crossed the border.‚ÄúThis must be a lesson for the rest of the world,‚Äù he said.The plea from WHO‚Äôs top official comes as the deadly coronavirus has now killed at least 362 people and sickened more than 17,400 worldwide, including patients in the U.S. and Europe.The respiratory illness, which is capable of spreading through human-to-human contact, is not yet considered a pandemic. A pandemic is ‚Äúan epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people,‚Äù according to WHO. While the new virus has spread to almost two dozen countries, the majority of the cases remain in mainland China.Nevertheless, many global health experts expect the virus will become a pandemic. Since emerging about a month ago in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus has infected more people than the 2003 SARS epidemic, which sickened roughly 8,100 people across the globe over nine months. As of Monday, there are nearly 200 cases in at least 23 countries, outside of China, a handful of which have been transmitted from human contact within those countries.On Thursday, WHO declared the virus a global health emergency after declining to do so at two previous meetings.Tedros said the ‚Äúcontinued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China‚Äù were ‚Äúmost deeply disturbing.‚ÄùFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC¬ª Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
