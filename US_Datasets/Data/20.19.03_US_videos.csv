She also shares some schedule changes and our enhanced coronavirus safety precautions.Keeping you and our crewmembers safe.Safety is our first priority at JetBlue, and we have worked diligently with the experts to make sure we are doing our part to slow the spread of coronavirus. For enhanced protection, you will see our crewmembers wearing medical-grade gloves for your safety and theirs. We are also temporarily limiting inflight food and beverage service to minimize touchpoints. Below you will find information on all of what we are doing as well as more about HEPA filter technology aboard all our aircraft.Reducing our flying to reflect demand.Based on the coronavirus pandemic, we are seeing fewer bookings, and in an effort to maintain a level of much-needed air service for critical travel, we will be adjusting our flight schedules in the coming months. Based on recent foreign government restrictions and general demand, we must streamline our operation, but we promise to continue to provide our legendary customer service.Is my flight cancelled?As we work to consolidate flights and service, we are doing everything we can to minimize impact to our customers‚Äô travel plans and provide as much notice as possible. Over the coming weeks, customers with flight itineraries that need to be adjusted will be contacted by JetBlue via email. Our self-service options will allow customers to accept an alternate itinerary or cancel their itinerary and rebook.Thank you.On behalf of everyone at JetBlue, we would like to thank our customers for their loyalty and understanding during this unprecedented time. We will continue to keep you informed here on our blog as the situation evolves and look forward to welcoming you whenever you are ready to travel with JetBlue."

In this video, I‚Äôm going to give you a complete home workout routine with all sets and reps included to help you to build muscle regardless of whether or not you ever step foot in a gym. The key to the effectiveness of this perfect home workout is that it pairs exercises together in a way that allows you to train to greater overload than would be possible if you stuck with one single exercise, and it will keep the workouts brief at the same time.This perfect home workout consists of not one but two complete total body workouts. The first, workout A, is to be performed on Monday and Friday of week 1. Workout B is to be performed on Wednesday. In week 2, this is flipped so that A is performed once on Wednesday and B is performed on both Monday and Friday. You can continue to alternate the workouts in this way if you decide to do this for longer.This workout for home is going to allow you to hit your total body in under one hour.With this being the goal, the idea is not to try and hit each muscle with too many individual exercises since this could lead to an excessively long workout and potential for doing too much in the given workout. Instead, we select the exercises based on movement patterns that we know we want to hit to accomplish our goal of building muscle everywhere.These patterns are broken down below and the exercises included in each are shown.Keep in mind, there are two complete versions of each workout to be sure that the beginners and more advanced trainees can follow this program and get results from it.Here is how to construct the perfect home total body workout A:1. SQUAT / ANTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Alt. Single Leg Box Squats (use low box if advanced / higher box for beginners)1 1/2 Bottomed Out Squats (to failure)Jump Squats2. UPPER PUSH (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Handstand Pushups OR Power PushawaysRotational Pushups OR Knee Rotational PushupsCobra Pushups (long head contracted) OR Knee Cobra Pushups3. HINGE / POSTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Alt. Single Leg Heel Touch Squats (use ‚Äúkickstand‚Äù if needed)Alt. Sprinter Lunges Plyo Sprinter Lunges (jump from higher position if more beginner)4. UPPER PULL (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Pullups OR Seated PullupsHuman Pullovers OR BW Sliding PulldownsInverted Chin Curls5. ABS (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Reverse CorkscrewsBlack Widow Knee SlidesLevitation Crunches6. CORRECTIVE (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Angels and DevilsCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)Here is how to construct the perfect home workout B:HINGE / POSTERIOR x 3 ROUNDSSlick Floor Bridge Curl (Single Leg) OR Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Dual Leg)Long Leg MarchHigh Hip BucksLUNGE / ANTERIOR x 3 ROUNDSAlt. Crossover Step UpsAlt. Reverse LungesSplit Squat JumpsUPPER PUSH x 3 ROUNDSVariable Wall Pushups OR Knee Decline Pushups to Knee Flat PushupsAlt. BW Side Lateral Raises (from knees for beginners)Tricep BW Extensions (long head stretch)UPPER PULL x 3 ROUNDSChin Ups OR Seated Chin UpsInverted RowsBack WidowsABS x 2 ROUNDSAb HalosV-Up TucksSit-Up Elbow ThrustsCORRECTIVE x 2 ROUNDSReverse HypersCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)If you are doing this workout just to try it out, then I would suggest you choose the workout A variation. That said, if you opt to do a more comprehensive total body split workout routine then you will want to either incorporate workouts A and B into a twice a week plan or, even better, alternating A and B on M, W and F each week.For a complete 6 week home workout plan, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below to get the athlean xero program.

He said countries must increase testing and isolate those who test positive, as well as close contacts, stressing their key message is test, test, test.Ghebreyesus added that as some countries have exceeded their capacities to care for patients with mild symptoms and they should focus on more severe cases and prioritize those with underlying conditions. He said mild cases could be isolated at home and gave directions on safety procedures on how to take care of patients at home, including sleeping in a different bedroom, using a different bathroom, and wearing protective masks.The director-general called COVID-19 the defining global health crisis of our time, and that fighting it would be a test of trust in science and in solidarity. He said moments like people applauding health workers in places like Italy shows the type of human solidarity that should become more infectious than the disease.***Please note that this press conference is virtual. ***For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6683518/who-testing-coronavirus-march-16/Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GlobalNews #COVID19 #Coronavirus"

He sees his music as therapeutic, not just for him, but for anyone who comes in contact with it.As genuine a modern day outlaw as you can get, Jelly's music incorporates influences ranging from Southern Rock to Dirty South rap. With his forthcoming album, A Beautiful Disaster, Jelly Roll draws you in with his ability to tell a story that you didn't even know you were a part of. With songs like Creature, I Need You, Nothing Left At All and the dark, haunting love story Suicide along with features from the likes of Tech N9ne, Struggle Jennings, Krizz Kaliko and Lil Wyte, A Beautiful Disaster gives you a direct link to the life of Jelly Roll - the trials and tribulations, along with the celebrations and victories."
