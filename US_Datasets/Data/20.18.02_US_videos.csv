In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder. Slowly add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and whisk thoroughly. 3) Use a silicone spatula to scrape the batter into a gallon ziploc bag then snip off a ½ inch hole. Hold the bag over the oil and gently squeeze to create an even stream of batter while moving the bag in a figure 8 motion until the surface area of the pot has been covered. 4) Fry for one minute then, very carefully, use a fork to flip the funnel cake over and fry for 30 seconds on the other side. Remove fro the oil then let drain on paper towels. Equipment: * Small sauce pot filled with oil * Large clear bowl (x2)* Whisk * Silspat* Ziplock bag (gallon)* Scissors* Fork* Sheet pan lined with paper towels Step 2: Strawberry KetchupIngredients* ½ cup water* 1 Tbsp tomato paste* 1 cup chopped strawberries* ½ cup sugar* 2 Tbsp white vinegar* ¼ tsp ground ginger* ⅛ tsp ground clove* ⅛ tsp ground cinnamon* 1 tsp salt1) Heat a small sauce pot on medium high heat. Add all ingredients to the pot, stir to combine, then allow to cook for 10 minutes while stirring. 2) When the strawberries have softened, add the mixture to a blender to puree, or use an immersion blender.3) Continue to cook down while stirring for an additional 15 minutes, until the mixture has turned into a thick paste. Equipment: * Small saucepot * Wooden spoon* Stick blender* Cutting board* Chef knife Step 3: Grill ItIngredients* 1 bowl sliced strawberries* 4 funnel cakes* ¼ cup strawberry ketchup* 8 slices quality White American cheese (like Boar’s head)* 2 Tbsp butter* ¼ cup powdered sugar1) Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Add two slices of white american cheese to the ugly side of each funnel cake (you’ll know which it is) then spread a healthy layer of strawberry ketchup on top of half the cheesed-up funnel cakes. Sandwich the funnel cakes together. 2) Heat ½ Tbsp butter in a pan on medium heat (or use a panini press if you have one!). When the butter is melted, add one sandwich to the pan, and use a spatula to press it all down. Flip after about 5 minutes, and continue to cook for an additional 4 on the other side. Remove from the pan and pop it in the oven for an additional 5 minutes just to melt the cheese3) Please share it with your friends I’m pretty sure they will love it and if they don’t that’s ok because you tried your hardest and that’s what really matters.Equipment: * Spoon* Pam* Griddle* Metal spatula * Sheet pan with silpat underneath * Knife for cutting * Cutting board * Sifter"

It’s now time to finally reach their dreams that are beautifully blooming.Furthermore, the title track, “FIESTA,” as the name implies, is expressed in a bold and glamorous manner through the image of “festivals,” depicting IZ*ONE as a group in their full bloom. If the strong passion of “La Vie en Rose” met with the lovely “Violeta” to express the group’s radiant future, “FIESTA” represents the effort to make their once dreamed of future into reality. In order to shine light on this long-awaited moment, IZ*ONE has finally blossomed through magnificent colors. With genuine hopes to fulfill their dream, IZ*ONE aims to soar higher than ever with their first studio album [BLOOM*IZ].- IZ*ONE Official Twitter : https://twitter.com/official_izone- IZ*ONE Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/official.izone- IZ*ONE Official Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/official_izone- IZ*ONE Official fancafe : http://cafe.daum.net/official-izone#BLOOM_IZ #아이즈원 #FIESTA"

Ante Chivas y en Guadalajara, La Máquina derrotó por 1-2 a la escuadra rojiblanca, con una gran exhibición de su portero, Jesús Corona. Con este resultado, los celestes llegaron a 10 unidades, mientras que el Rebaño se quedó con seis puntos.Los goles celestes corrieron por cuenta de Jonathan Rodríguez y Adrián Aldrete, mientras que del lado rojiblanco, Alexis Vega sumó vía penal. Para la siguiente jornada, La Máquina se medirá ante Tigres, en el Estadio Azteca, mientras que Chivas visitará a Xolos, en Tijuana.EL PARTIDOEn actividad de la jornada 6 de la LIGA BBVA MX, Chivas recibió a Cruz Azul en la cancha del Estadio Akron. Fue un duelo abierto, en el que ambos escuadrones se recargaron en su ofensiva, acudiendo al ataque desde el inicio. Al minuto 8, Jonathan Rodríguez ya había adelantado a la visita, luego de un potente remate cercano al área rojiblanca. Y sería hasta el 25’, que el Rebaño conseguiría el empate.Por vía del manchón penal, Alexis Vega logró el empate para Chivas; la escuadra de casa proponía entonces las mejores opciones de ofensiva. Al 42’, en el cobro de un tiro libre, Adrián Aldrete colocó el segundo tanto celeste. En el complemento, sobre todo Chivas, ofreció una propuesta ofensiva, pero ahí apareció siempre Jesús Corona, para salvaguardar el arco de Cruz Azul."

Welcome to another episode of thrift store makeovers/thrift flips. I love hunting through thrift stores to find old, rejected items and then decorating them and putting my own style on them to turn them into new pieces of art. Today I decided to use an antique clutch (satchel lol) and I decorated it using leather paints. I hope you like bright, colorful designs, and butterflies! Also, bringing back the fruit theme so get ready for that.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

Matt Reeves revealed on Twitter, this video was shot by The Batman’s cinematographer Greig Fraser and scored by the movie’s composer Michael Giacchino.While the cast for The Batman has been high caliber all around, the actual look and feel of the movie has still been a big mystery with teases ranging from Reeves posting images from Adam West's Batman '66 to Robert Pattinson teasing a more brutal, less heroic take on the character.With the star and director in place, a lot more information has since come to light. While the actual plot remains a mystery, a reported working title of “Vengeance” left some fans guessing as to what the story might be about. Plus, details that some scenes will take place in Arkham Asylum have left even more fans wondering. There is also confirmation that our hero will encounter a lot of his famous rivals during this new standalone story as well, including Riddler and Penguin.It's unknown yet where The Batman will pick up in terms of Bruce Wayne's life, but considering the working title, it's difficult not to assume that his parents death will be a primary motivation for his actions.The majority of the cast involved with The Batman have already been announced. Zoë Kravitz will step into the shoes of Selina Kyle (Catwoman), Colin Farrell will play Oswald Cobblepot (Penguin), and Paul Dano will reportedly play the main villain of the film, Edward Nashton aka Riddler. Jeffrey Wright (Westworld) has also landed the role of Commissioner Gordon.Key DC movie release dates include:Birds Of Prey (And The Fantabulous Emancipation Of One Harley Quinn) (2020)Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)The Batman (2021)The Suicide Squad (2021)Black Adam (2021)Aquaman 2 (2022)The Batman movie will swoop into theaters on June 25, 2021.

A few months ago, I found out that Amazon started offering a personal shopping service. That's right, Amazon was styling people for a small fee each month - so I figured, we had to try it out to see what kind of clothing & accessories they would send me, and if they would be any good. So we took a quiz and good ole' Bezos sent me a sack of clothes. What do you guys think of my Amazon personal shopper haul? EDIT (for clarity) - although I eliminated most color options in the quiz, I did leave on every pattern except animal print, I said that I often wear edgy styles and I also liked boho styles, said that I would try pretty much every trend except for animal print and cropped pants, and clicked yes on multiple silhouettes and clothing items - so they had plenty of optionality! just in case you guys missed some answers!This video is NOT sponsored!You can check out our Colourpop frankenlipsticks here! https://colourpop.com/collections/safiya-nygaard-makeupSafiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/Check out our merch here: https://fiendsbysaf.com/If your size is sold out, sign up for email updates!MUSICVia AudioNetworkAssistant EditorsEmily Linden & Josie Latino"

Censors have been erasing critical social media sites. At least two outspoken citizen journalists have disappeared. Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin are among those whose whereabouts are unknown. And citizens were outraged at the death of Wuhan Doctor Li Wenliang, who raised the alarm about the virus. Meanwhile, China has reported 97 more deaths from the Corona virus and more than two thousand new infections, claiming these are the lowest figures since January. Officials also predict the epidemic could be over by April. But the World Health Organization disagrees, arguing it's too early to say whether infections have peaked. They're warning the outbreak poses a global threat potentially worse than terrorism. And people in and outside of China are beginning to question the accuracy of the information they are getting.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dw_stories/Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#Coronavirus #ChenQiushi #DWNews"

They don’t know where they are, or how they got there. They don't know they’ve been chosen… for a very specific purpose … The Hunt. In the shadow of a dark internet conspiracy theory, a group of elites gathers for the very first time at a remote Manor House to hunt ordinary Americans for sport. But the elites’ master plan is about to be derailed because one of The Hunted, Crystal (Betty Gilpin, GLOW), knows The Hunters’ game better than they do. She turns the tables on the killers, picking them off, one by one, as she makes her way toward the mysterious woman (two-time Oscar® winner Hilary Swank) at the center of it all. From Jason Blum, the producer of Get Out and The Purge series, and Damon Lindelof, creator of the HBO series Watchmen and co-creator of the TV series Lost, comes a timely and provocative new satirical thriller that has already ignited a national conversation. Now, it’s time to decide for yourself. The Hunt is written by Lindelof and his fellow Watchmen collaborator Nick Cuse and is directed by Craig Zobel (Z for Zachariah, The Leftovers). Blum produces for his Blumhouse Productions alongside Lindelof. The film is executive produced by Zobel, Cuse and Steven R. Molen."

They’re all important parts of the tale of the axion - a tale whose end may take us beyond the standard model and solve one of the most vexing mysteries in astrophysics. Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'Dowd & Graeme GosselGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealPost Production: Yago Ballarini, Max Willians, Pedro OsinskiDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberThe story of the axion is a classic physics tale: intrepid scientists delve deep into trackless mathematics in search of answers to a mystery. And there, against all expectations, they find the hint of a completely new and unexpected denizen of the natural world. In this case the mystery was a subtle inconsistency in the behavior of the fundamental forces. And the unexpected discovery? A brand new particle - the axion - which, while not proven to exist, may explain a much more famous conundrum. The axion may explain dark matter.
