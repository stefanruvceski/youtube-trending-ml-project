This journey is about reuniting with your self through regular practice. Through the process of getting to know who you really are, you will find that you need not prioritize the where, or the what, as much.

Does more expensive mean more better? And is it worth it? Let‚Äôs find out.We bought two identical 350Zs and have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track. James Pumphrey and Zach Jobe are on Team Hi, and their car gets the expensive parts. Nolan Sykes and Aaron Parker are on team Low. Their car gets the cheap ones.Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We‚Äôve been focusing on improving our cars performance, but today we‚Äôre focusing on the interior...performance. So we‚Äôre going to be throwing in new seats, and ALSO adding in roll cages and harnesses.Team Hi got $900 Sparco QRT-R seats.Team Low I got $450 Corbeau FX1 Pro seats.Cars aren‚Äôt necessarily one-size-fits all. Especially small sports cars like our Zs. You might find the stock driving position uncomfortable. Sometimes the seats don‚Äôt hold you well enough going around a corner and you get flung to the side. If you‚Äôve got short legs and a long torso, or long legs and a short torso, things just might not feel right.  That‚Äôs where aftermarket interior parts can come in. A race seat can hold you in place better and make it easier for you to corner hard‚Ä¶ or it can be horribly uncomfortable if it doesn‚Äôt fit your body right. Maybe the more expensive seat has a nicer quality material on it, but the overall shape and size of the seat is really going to be a matter of personal preference. The cheaper seat might be the right choice anyway if it‚Äôs going to be easier to live with and drive in every day.Even though Nolan is going with a cheaper option he didn't go with the cheapest option. All of his stuff is FIA approved.

With luxury cars it's better to let someone else buy it new and take the huge depreciation hit first. Then you can buy it at an amazing price with low mileage and just a few years old.

Here I‚Äôm going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it‚Äôs something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn‚Äôt giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it‚Äôs doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I‚Äôm asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don‚Äôt worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don‚Äôt forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

Today I am going to be ranking ALL of the squishy creations that I've made in my squishy makeover series over the las year. This includes 41 squishies from a total of 13 different makeover videos. I have put sooo much time in painting, fixing and decorating all of these. It's been a great year for creating things on my channel! Not only for squishy makeovers, but also my other thrift store finds, baking videos, create this book and other random customization projects. I hope you guys have enjoyed this past year of content from me, it's been fun! I'm looking forward another great year of creative projects.PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysasQfKtxI0&list=PL807ptvhwHpcHoHa30Lq-uL8Kcxgpa39wFUN FACTS?‚ÄìI did 57 squishies and 14 videos LAST year. So I only did 1 less video this year than last year BUT, I made 16 fewer squishies. I focused more on quality, less on quantity this year!‚ÄìIf you‚Äôre wondering how we are only on episode #19 of squishy makeovers, it‚Äôs because that number only goes with the ‚Äúfixing your squishies‚Äù series. It doesn‚Äôt include any special episodes like ‚Äúspeed makeovers,‚Äù ‚Äú3 color challenge,‚Äù ‚Äúbear bread series‚Äù or any regular squishy makeovers where I am using my own squishiess.__________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.
