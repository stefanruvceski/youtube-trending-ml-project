La bici encima del barro,con un vaso de plástico en la gomapa que suene como un carro.Recargábamos batería con malta indiay pan con ajo, nadie nos detenía. Éramos inseparables, hasta que un díalo mataron entre cuatro policías.Mi alegría sigue rota,se apagaron las luces en el parque de pelotaYa no queda casi nadie aquí,A veces ya no quiero estar aquí.Me siento solo aquí, en el medio de la fiesta.Quiero estar en donde nadie me molesta,quemar mi libreta, soltar mi maleta.Quiero llamar al 7550822a ver quién contestaLas peleas con mi padrastrocuando perdía el control,las resolvía con elviendo un partido de beisbol.Me invitó a pelear un par de veces,Me escapé de casa un par de veces.Pero nunca faltó el alimento,nos defendió con músicatocando en casamientos.A veces al horno, a veces de lata y microondas.Compartíamos todo, la mesa era redonda.Clase media baja,nunca fuimos dueños.El préstamo del banco,se robaba nuestro sueño.La cuenta de ahorro vacía,pero mami bailando flamenconos alegraba el día.Dejó de actuar pa cuidarnos a los cuatroy nos convertimos en su obra de teatro.Ella se puso nuestras botas,y su vida fue de nuestros logrosy nuestras derrotas.Mi padrastro se fue con otros peces,nos mudamos de la calle 13.Me fui a buscar la suerte en un mar de paja,y mi vida entera la empaqué en una caja.En la universidad de arte me becaron,a la mitad de mis amigos los mataron.Empecé a rapear denuevo, empecé a creer denuevo. Volví, saqué un disco.Redes: Official Site: http://residente.comFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/residenteTwitter: http://twitter.com/ResidenteInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/residenteSuscríbete! https://smarturl.it/subscriberesidente#Residente #RenéOfficial Music Video by Residente performing “René” © 2020 Sony Music Entertainment US Latin LLC"

I'm just proud of myself is all. This video is about how I am dumb. It's an edited down list of things that really put into perspective of how square brained I am. There was more stuff I didn't include or cut out because it's not much of a story / I realized my realizations were not right. Here's a bonus though: I thought fool proof was full proof for the longest time.I tried putting bg music in this video. I think the end product came out pretty well. Hopefully you like it too. Probably will do more in future videos.There's a stream coming after I post this video in a couple hours.

This summer, Oscar® winner Jordan Peele unleashes a fresh take on the blood-chilling urban legend that your friend’s older sibling probably told you about at a sleepover: Candyman. Rising filmmaker Nia DaCosta (Little Woods) directs this contemporary incarnation of the cult classic.  For as long as residents can remember, the housing projects of Chicago’s Cabrini Green neighborhood were terrorized by a word-of-mouth ghost story about a supernatural killer with a hook for a hand, easily summoned by those daring to repeat his name five times into a mirror. In present day, a decade after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, visual artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; HBO’s Watchmen, Us) and his girlfriend, gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris; If Beale Street Could Talk, The Photograph), move into a luxury loft condo in Cabrini, now gentrified beyond recognition and inhabited by upwardly mobile millennials.With Anthony’s painting career on the brink of stalling, a chance encounter with a Cabrini Green old-timer (Colman Domingo; HBO’s Euphoria, Assassination Nation) exposes Anthony to the tragically horrific nature of the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifyingly viral wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny.Universal Pictures presents, from Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures and Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld’s Monkeypaw Productions, in association with BRON Creative, Candyman. Candyman is directed by DaCosta, and is produced by Ian Cooper (Us), Rosenfeld and Peele. The screenplay is by Peele & Rosenfeld and DaCosta. The film is based on the 1992 film Candyman, written by Bernard Rose, and the short story “The Forbidden” by Clive Barker. The film’s executive producers are David Kern, Aaron L. Gilbert and Jason Cloth."

Thank you for caring about me. It means more to me than you could possibly know. ---In January 2020, a documentary was released called “The Witnesses.” TRIGGER WARNING: basically all the worst things people can do“The Witnesses” can be found on Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/A-Window-For-Justice/dp/B084TDX7L3or Oxygen: https://www.oxygen.com/the-witnesses/season-1/the-watchtowerand also on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/tv/show?id=S9vTv9nX1qTSiAwvdSGC-Q and other places on the internet if you dig deep enough. I encourage you to watch it and share it. I believe the survivors. I know survivors. I am a survivor. (UPDATE 2/29:If you need resources or are looking for answers about the JWs:https://www.jwfacts.com/ & https://jw.support/ alsohttps://www.youtube.com/user/johncedars1929 )---I can’t describe what it feels like to be a child rejected by their parent. It strips you of your humanity. It makes you a shell. Nothing more than an object someone can opt-in to cherish and love when convenient for them and their beliefs. It reduces you to a choice. I am not a choice. I am a person deserving of love and respect. Back in August, my Dad and step-mom pulled me aside to tell me that they would not be coming to my wedding. I had included them on a list of “family” e-mails my wedding planner asked for, but had assumed we would all silently agree not to discuss it. That surely I had suffered enough. That I had struggled enough. That I had lost enough family already. But they needed to remind me that my love was unnatural, immoral, and a crime within their organization.  To remind me that Ella wasn’t worthy of being in a family photo. And lastly, to remind me that if I ever used my public platform to speak out against their organization that that “would be it.”It’s taken me six months to decide I am comfortable with that. My Dad is an Elder. I was a raised a Jehovah’s Witness. I was never baptized. However, I grew up in the organization, I can recite all the names of the literature from memory, I’ve been to more District Conventions and Memorial Services than I care to recall. I’ve gone out in Field Service. I’ve preached Door to Door. I still have the songs singing in my head. I grew up fearing my annihilation and the annihilation of everyone who is not a Witness. Returning to the choices we make… I choose to share this:I do not believe it is a safe or healthy environment for women or children. I believe it protects those it should not protect. I believe it holds itself above the law. I believe it is a cult. If you would like to learn more about The Witnesses - I encourage you to speak to people who have fled the cult and lost everything in the process. Again, I was never officially baptized, and yet this organization has taken from me something I desperately wanted to carry through this life and into the next - the unconditional love and support of a parent."

In this video, I’m going to show you the biomechanical and scientific reason why this is the case for you and, more importantly, give you an exercise for your chest that will make it grow better than everything else you’ve tried.The key to a bigger chest is making sure that you are activating the pecs and not your shoulders and triceps during your pressing. Some of the limitations of the bench press are known to be inhibiting the very activation that you are seeking. These are worsened by the fact that some people just aren’t genetically as predisposed to flourish with the bench press.Let’s start by discussing the biomechanical limitations of this popular chest exercise. First, the range of motion. We know that horizontal adduction of the arm across the chest (at the shoulder joint) is one of the primary functions of the pec major / chest muscles. During the bench press, your arm only goes through about a total of 80 to 90 degrees of adduction. This comes from a negative fifteen degrees at the bottom of the bench press up to about 70 degrees or so at the top of the rep.When people have a hard time building their chest they simply don’t get enough activation of the pecs to stimulate growth. This is worsened by the fact that they often substitute pec contraction for deltoid and triceps activation to move the bar. The second thing to note is that the strength curve of the bench press is descending, meaning that as the bar moves away from the chest the exercise gets easier and tension is lost on the pecs. So when the shoulder is in its most adducted position, the corresponding tension on the pecs is at its lowest. This again does not bode well for the exercise in its capacity to add lots of mass to the chest.Biologically speaking, certain individuals have lower proportions of fast twitch fibers in their chest, which only further decreases the responsiveness of the exercise to a heavily loaded exercise like the bench press. Don’t misunderstand, the bench is a formidable exercise for your chest in terms of its ability to be progressively overloaded and to create chest growth by simply applying more tension to the chest than other pec exercises. It just isn’t enough.The length of ones arms can also be a negative when it comes to seeing chest gains during the bench press. Those with longer arms will have a harder time creating the leverage needed to lift heavy weights on the exercise and therefore tend to struggle more with letting the chest lean on the delts and triceps too much for assistance during the lift.The answer to your problems is to incorporate the cable chest press with adduction as well. This powerful chest mass booster is one of the most underrated and effective exercises for building a bigger chest. The key to the success of this chest movement is the fact that it addresses all the primary weaknesses of the barbell bench press. Not only can you get much more adduction from the movement but the tension on the chest at the peak of adduction is far greater, leading to more overall stimulation during the exercise.Additionally, the strength curve compliments that of the barbell bench press and allows for a much better stimulation of the chest over a greater portion of the range of motion. Using this along with the bench press performed heavy, is one of the best one-two combos you can use when you are trying to build a big chest.Be sure to follow the tips for setting up this exercise correctly and how to perform it with proper form so as not to leave any of the potential gains on the table. I include setup instructions in the video as well.If you are looking to build a bigger chest fast and feel glad you found this video but wish you had a complete workout program that would get you results without thinking, be sure to check out my programs at athleanx.com via the link below and start training with science.
