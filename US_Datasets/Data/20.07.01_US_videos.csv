The Golden Globes serve as the official kickoff to the 2020 awards season. Twenty-five categories - 14 in film and 11 in television - are voted on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). The Golden Globe Awards, often referred to as “Hollywood’s Party of the Year™,” is one of the biggest nights on the calendar for live viewing. It’s also one of the few awards shows that combines the honorees of both film and television.Ricky Gervais' Monologue - 2020 Golden Globeshttps://youtu.be/LCNdTLHZAeoNBC on YouTubehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc"

But what really got me were the emotional moments. I kid you not, I shed a couple tears tonight!What’s up? It’s Drew Dorsey here with Clevver News and award season is officially underway!There were so many moments to talk about, but I’m here to talk about the tear jerking moments. And grab your tissues because emotions were running high!Let’s start with Tom Hanks who was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille award.It was a huge honor and just the montage before his acceptance speech was enough to get me emotional. But his speech set me over the edge.When he thanked his wife there wasn’t a dry eye in the audience or at home. You have to see it for yourself.I mean, my heart can’t take it! And neither could fans on Twitter.One person said quote, “HARD TO NOT CRY WHEN TOM HANKS CRIES.”And another said quote, “I MEAN. WOW. #TomHanks is a worldwide treasure and we need to protect him at all costs. Also, excuse me while I wipe up the entire lake of tears I shed during his speech. @tomhanks”BRB still crying over this entire moment.And if that wasn’t enough to make you shed a tear, let’s talk about Kate McKinnon presenting Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award.She opened up about how Ellen made her feel comfortable with her sexuality and how she’s paved the way for many people in the LGBTQ+ community in Hollywood.And fans are really connecting with this moment as well.One person tweeted saying quote, “I became super emotional watching Ellen DeGeneres--that people sought to dim her light is unacceptable. All I can say is, Equality is non-negotiable. And @RepHartzler --your discriminatory + hateful views on the LGBTQ+ community have no place in Congress.”And another said quote, “It was amazing, and so was Kate Mckinnon’s introduction. It was just what I needed today. The world needs more Ellen’s.”And we couldn’t agree more!The last emotional moment we will talk about for today, because I don’t want you all crying too much, is Jennifer Anniston talking about the Australian fires.Many celebs brought attention to the tragic fires that are currently happening in Australia.Jenn read Russell Crowe’s acceptance speech for him because he is back home in Australia helping his family affected by the fires.She got choked up when reading it and fans talked about this moment on Twitter.One fan tweeted saying quote, “No, YOU were getting emotional watching Jennifer Aniston fighting off tears reading Russell Crowe's acceptance speech on the Australia fires.”And another said quote, “Jennifer Aniston did a superb job hosting and reading out Russel Crowe’s message with sincerity and empathy”And we totally get it. The fires are tragic and we’d like to help however we can.In our description we’ve linked some ways to donate and get involved. Please consider donating if you are able to!And I want to hear from you all which moment made you cry the most.Was it Tom Hanks or Kate McKinnon or someone else?Let me know down in the comments below.After that, why don’t you dive in to more Clevver News by hitting that subscribe button and click that bell so you don’t miss any of our new stories.

In this video, I’m going to show you how to never do them incorrectly again and give you the fixes for the 10 most common pullup mistakes.  Whether you can do 10 pull-ups or more now or struggle to do one, you’ll find this incredibly helpful and I guarantee you will be doing more reps by the time the video is over.The first thing you need to be aware of is how you are gripping the bar. If you grip too narrow you will shift the focus of the movement from the stronger back muscles to the weaker muscles of the forearms. You want to make sure you are just outside of shoulder width with the hand placement for optimal performance on this exercise.That said, the brachioradialis and brachialis are muscles that are going to be contributing to the pullup and your ability to do the most reps possible so you are going to need to train them. You just don’t want them being the main drivers of the exercise. To supplement your back muscles in the exercise, be sure to include some cross body hammer curls as shown to increase the strength of the forearms and your overall strength on the pullup.Regarding the grip placement, it isn’t enough to just get the hand spacing down. You also want to be sure that you direct your pressure in the right way. Most people simply pull straight down on the bar or worse, they pull outwards because they’ve been told this will increase the activation of the lats. Both of these aren’t optimal. The best thing you can do is squeeze your hands inward towards each other and down at the same time. This will engage much more upper body muscle activation that will make your body feel as if it is floating up above the bar on every rep, instantly.Much of this has to do with plugging kinetic looseness (or energy leaks as I call them). You can take this even a step further by contracting other areas of your body that often get ignored during the exercise like your legs, ankles and core. Instead of dangling from the bar and letting your knees hang loosely, tighten you quads, point your feet down and really contract your core muscles and you will see an instant improvement in your ability to lift your body up over the bar.Now you don’t want to take these measures and then let it all loosen up when you get to the bottom of the rep. Most importantly, you do not want to get lax during the hanging portion of the pullup. This will place too much strain on the shoulders and is called unpacking. Instead, even though you want to get fully straightened at the elbows you want to keep your shoulder blades pulled down and back to create shoulder stability. This will allow for a lifetime of injury free pullups and more growth from the exercise.There are other biomechanical flaws that you will want to avoid with your pullups that I cover here but I also want to point out a couple of the programming issues that are often done incorrectly as well. For instance, you don’t want to always save your pullups for the end of your workout. Too often, because they are a bodyweight exercise, we save them for after we have already done our rows, deadlifts or pulldowns. You will never get the most out of the exercise when done in a fatigued state like this. Try moving them to the front of your workout and you will be surprised at how quickly you see gains just by making the switch.Finally, the exercise like any other, will respond to intensification techniques like drop sets and changes in the weight used during it. Use a band to accommodate your fatigue and get more total reps done in a workout - either as a drop set or as a simple lightening of the load as you would with any other traditional back exercise in your workout.If you’re looking for a program that will help you to do many more pullups while at the same time getting you in the best overall shape of your life, head to athleanx.com at the link below and follow the same step by step training that has created ripped athletic bodies for men and women of all ages and all levels of athleticism.

Of course, none of us wanted her to leave but we will always support her and love her no matter where life takes her. We wish her well with all her ventures and we hope you guys will too. This has been a very difficult decision for all of us to process and we know it’ll be tough for you guys too but please be kind as we all move forward. We really appreciate your kindness during this time.The door will always be open for her if she ever wants to return. We love her as a sister first, and we always will. We remain very close to her as her family.We are grateful for the 10 years that we had with her in the band and we wish her the best in her new chapter of life.Rest assured that Cimorelli will continue in 2020 onward with the other 5 of us. 2019 was one of the best years ever for Cimorelli and we are so grateful we had Dani as a part of it. We will do our best to move forward and kick butt in our new format and we look forward to sharing many new projects with you all in 2020. We will be grieving right alongside all of you but will also do our best to uplift you guys along the way with our new projects.Love you guys and thank you for understanding.- Cimorelli"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"PUyKPpqY2yA","Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Spokesman Breaks Down Over Soleimani's Death on State TV","2020-01-03T13:57:59.000Z","UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA","QuickTake by Bloomberg","25","20.07.01","iran|trump|war|war with iran","433421","2602","1660","5321","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PUyKPpqY2yA/default.jpg","False","False","President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. airstrike that killed one of Iran’s most powerful generals and sent global markets reeling in response to the threat of an “imminent attack,” Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said Friday.Pompeo would not provide details about the threat other than to say it was confined to the Middle East and that it justified the airstrike. Iran’s Supreme Leader quickly threatened “severe retaliation” in response. The U.S. State Department has issued a directive urging American citizens to leave Iraq immediately due to the tensions.Oil futures in London and New York at one point surged by more than 4%, gold hit the highest in four months, 10-year Treasury yields headed for the biggest drop in three weeks and stocks and U.S. equity futures slid.Qassem Soleimani, who led proxy militias that extended Iran’s power across the Middle East, was killed in a strike in Baghdad authorized by Trump, the Defense Department said in a statement late Thursday. Trump, who is staying at Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said on Twitter Friday that “Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!” and the U.S. embassy in Baghdad urged its citizens to leave the country.“We don’t seek war with Iran,” Pompeo said in an interview on Fox Friday morning. “But we, at the same time, are not going to stand by and watch the Iranians escalate and continue to put American lives at risk without responding in a way that disrupts, defends, deters and creates an opportunity to de-escalate the situation.”“At the direction of the president, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing” Soleimani, the Pentagon said. “General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.”Pompeo said the decision to strike was based on intelligence collection and that the attack “saved American lives.”The death of Soleimani, who led the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds force, fueled concerns that the U.S. and Iran could be drawn into an armed confrontation that could easily pull in other countries. The pressures, which have been building for months, have been complicated by widespread protests in Iraq and Iran.“Qassem Soleimani embodied Iran’s extraterritorial activism in the Middle East,” said Asif Shuja, a senior research fellow at Singapore’s Middle East Institute. “His assassination is thus bound to be a turning point.”Iran’s top leaders all condemned the attack and vowed to hit back while Foreign Minister Javad Zarif denounced the killing on Twitter as “an act of international terrorism.” Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is due to attend an emergency meeting of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council for the first time, the state-owned Hamshahri newspaper reported. He vowed to avenge Soleimani’s killing.“A severe retaliation awaits murderers who have the blood of Soleimani and that of other martyrs on their wicked hands from last night’s incident,” Khamenei said in a statement.The Iranian leadership is signaling that it will likely target U.S. military installations and bases in the Middle East and mobilize its network of militias across the region. One official told the state broadcaster that some 36 U.S. military bases and facilities are within reach of Iran’s defense forces, with the closest being in Bahrain. A spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards said the assassination marked the start of a “new phase” in the activities of Iran’s “resistance forces” throughout the region.A September attack on Saudi oil facilities -- for which Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility -- highlighted the potential impact of Tehran’s response.Trump’s European allies urged the president to find a way to ease the tensions with Tehran and warned of the risks that a cycle of retaliations would spiral out of control.French President Emmanuel Macron is speaking to his counterparts in the Middle East in an effort to prevent the situation spiraling out of control, European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin said on RTL radio. “This is what we feared,” she said. “It’s a continuation of the escalation that’s been happening over recent months.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman said the U.S. had been provoked by Iran and urged all sides to reduce the tensions.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

The video flashed through snippets of their year – from their trips to Morocco and South Africa to their run-in with Beyonce and Jay-Z at The Lion King premiere – and ended on a never-before-seen shot of Harry carrying Archie. We hope 2020 brings each of you health and continued happiness, Harry and Meghan wrote in part alongside the video.» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AHSub» Visit Our Website: http://www.AccessOnline.com/Get More Access:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/accessonlineTwitter: https://twitter.com/accessonline Instagram: http://instagram.com/accessonlineSnapchat: OfficialAccess#AccessHollywood#PrinceHarry#MeghanMarkle#Royals"

With luxury cars it's better to let someone else buy it new and take the huge depreciation hit first. Then you can buy it at an amazing price with low mileage and just a few years old.

Today I am going to be ranking ALL of the squishy creations that I've made in my squishy makeover series over the las year. This includes 41 squishies from a total of 13 different makeover videos. I have put sooo much time in painting, fixing and decorating all of these. It's been a great year for creating things on my channel! Not only for squishy makeovers, but also my other thrift store finds, baking videos, create this book and other random customization projects. I hope you guys have enjoyed this past year of content from me, it's been fun! I'm looking forward another great year of creative projects.PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysasQfKtxI0&list=PL807ptvhwHpcHoHa30Lq-uL8Kcxgpa39wFUN FACTS?–I did 57 squishies and 14 videos LAST year. So I only did 1 less video this year than last year BUT, I made 16 fewer squishies. I focused more on quality, less on quantity this year!–If you’re wondering how we are only on episode #19 of squishy makeovers, it’s because that number only goes with the “fixing your squishies” series. It doesn’t include any special episodes like “speed makeovers,” “3 color challenge,” “bear bread series” or any regular squishy makeovers where I am using my own squishiess.__________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.
