However, as the city, located in central China's Hubei Province, is now hosting the vast majority of the confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, medical staff across hospitals in Wuhan have faced up to their responsibilities regardless of the risks and sacrifices.On the early morning of Saturday, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the country's grandest traditional festival that was supposed to be filled with fun activities and events, doctors and nurses from the Jinyintan Hospital did not even have time to take a rest.Ding Na is a nurse working in the ICU of the hospital, one that has been at the frontier of the battle for nearly a month since it took in the first infected patient on Dec 29 last year.Her husband is a physician who works on a different floor in the same building. However, over the past 28 days, they did not quite have any chance to meet each other nor much time to rest at home.This has lead to the husband's locker becoming a mail box for the couple to keep in touch and care for each other.I come here every day to bring him tidy clothes here and take away the dirty ones home, as she told the China Central Television (CCTV) reporter.Knowing well about the threat they faced in the fight against the virus better than anyone, the medical workers have still chosen to stick to their duties and try their best to free the patients away from the pain.I hope with our efforts, we are able to control the epidemic at an earlier date so that none of our families, colleagues, friends and fellow citizens suffer anymore, said Guo Wei, deputy head of infection division from Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

I just like painting on things üòÇ PLUS, I feel like a lot of challenges these days have gotten really pointless. But, this one is good haha. I decided to try  to paint and decorate different things for 24 hours. I have a lot of art supplies laying around my art room, just begging to be painted. But I don't often have the time to paint that much at a time. So this was a great opportunity to put a bunch of it to good use finally.I am going to be painting on a seashell, painting a pencil pouch, painting a rock, painting a squishy (mini squishy makeover lol), making a custom mug, decorating a giant clothes pin and a surprise weird item LOL.

But the individual feud between those two wasn't just a battle within that war. It was personal. It was beef.Starting with his trade to the Pistons in the early 1980s, Laimbeer built a reputation as not just a strong rebounder and scorer, but a relentless pest. On one hand, he'd make dirty and dangerous plays, then act like nothing had happened. On the other hand, he'd flop and whine to bait the referees into calling fouls on his opponents. Nobody despised Laimbeer for this quite as much as Bird did. Bird's public campaign against Laimbeer's style of play dated back to the Celtics-Pistons playoff series in 1985, and really took off after Laimbeer started a brawl by fouling Bird hard in the 1987 playoffs. Bird accused Laimbeer of intentionally trying to injure him, and never withdrew the accusation. Even decades later, these two NBA legends maintain an icy distance because of how things played out on the court. This beef might never end, so in this episode, we learn about what built it.Written and produced by Seth RosenthalDirected and edited by Jiazhen ZhangSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com"

Does more expensive mean more better? We‚Äôre gonna find out once and for all.Donut bought two identical Nissan 350z‚Äôs, and for the past few weeks have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track.Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) got a bunch of really cheap parts and in the end got  a slammed turbo z that shoots flames all for around $13,000.Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) on the other hand, got a bunch of really nice expensive stuff totaling an astounding $33,000.  Then we tested them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We‚Äôre gonna break down the cost of building these two cars, test them head to head on track, and decide which is better. Low Car got a set of eBay coilovers of unknown origin,  and Hi Car was treated to a set of KW V3s. Next, we installed wheels and tires. Hi Car got some sick Advan RGIII‚Äôs wrapped in Bridgestone RE71s. Meanwhile on the Low Car, We bought some XXR 527s, and decided to run Federal RS-RR tires. In the end, both cars were able to achieve supercar-level braking distance by switching to super sticky rubber. Nolan and Aaron installed more aggressive brake pads, steel braided brake lines, flushed and replaced the brake fluid, and bled the lines. Over on Hi Car, Zach and James replaced the car‚Äôs entire braking system with a 6 piston, 13 brake kit from Wilwood. After that we went inside our Zs, installing racing seats. The Hi Car got two Sparco QRT-R seats, a Greddy steering wheel, and a hub to make it removable. Lo Car received some Corbeau DFXs racing seats.Next, both cars were fitted with modified differentials to make sick skids easier. Hi Car got a very trick Kaaz 2-way differential. Zach spent a lot of time adjusting the spacing, making sure it was perfect. Over on Lo Car we took a different route. Instead of installing a new differential, we welded ours together!After making a bunch of performance upgrades, it was time to alter the looks of our beloved Zs. Team Low decided to give Lo Car some plastidip.Over on team Hi, they took their car to a professional vinyl shop.Finally, we gave the Donut Zs some BOOST! Hi car got a Jim Wolf  twin turbo setup that made it sound like a Baby GTR. And the low car got a single turbo kit by way of eBay.Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!‚ñ∫Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

This test, which does not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, is intended to demonstrate Crew Dragon‚Äôs ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. The six-hour test window opens at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC. A backup opportunity with the same six-hour launch window opening at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC, is available on Monday, January 20. Current weather data suggests our best opportunity for the launch escape test will be towards the end of the four-hour window, but we will continue to provide updates as new data becomes available."
