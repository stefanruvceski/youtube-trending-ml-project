TMZ has learned.The rapper was at a home in the Hollywood Hills at around 4:30 AM when 2 men wearing hoodies and masks broke into a house ... this according to law enforcement sources. We're told the 2 men fired multiple shots, striking and critically wounding Pop Smoke. The men were seen fleeing on foot.Pop Smoke was rushed by ambulance to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in West Hollywood where he was pronounced dead.The suspects have not been caught and as far as we know they have not been identified.  It's unclear if Pop Smoke knew the shooters. One man was placed in handcuffs but cops determined he was not involved and was released.Pop Smoke released an album back in July and one of the songs, Welcome to the Party, blew up ... it was considered by many the song of the summer. Nicki Minaj did a remix of the song a few months later. He also did a song, Gatti, with Travis Scott.6:56 AM PT -- The home is owned by Teddi Mellencamp's husband, Edwin Arroyave, who owns several homes in Los Angeles. It's possible Pop Smoke was renting the property.7:08 AM PT -- Nicki Minaj just posted a cryptic message ... The Bible tells us that jealousy is as cruel as the grave. Unbelievable. Rest in Peace, Pop. By using the term jealousy, she seems to be saying there's a connection between the killers and Pop Smoke.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg makes his debate debut, as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders takes the lead in the polls.Just three days before the crucial Nevada caucuses, Democratic candidates took the stage in a contentious debate, firing off rounds of attacks on newcomer Mike Bloomberg.Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former New York Mayor Bloomberg spent two hours Wednesday night duking it out at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino.It was the ninth overall debate – and the most pugnacious. But it was the first that featured Bloomberg, who doesn’t take campaign contributions and did not qualify for previous ones because he didn’t meet donor thresholds.The debate opened with Warren and Sanders, who have built their campaigns around the promise to reduce wealth inequality, throwing jabs at Bloomberg, who has spent about $400 million of his personal fortune on campaign ads. since joining the race in late November. Despite his presence at the Nevada debate, Bloomberg is not on a ballot until Super Tuesday March 3.Sanders maintains a lead in national polls and held a 19-point edge in Nevada, according to a survey released Monday. The Nevada caucuses could present an opportunity for Biden, who maintained the lead for months, to bounce back against Sanders.However, Biden, the former front-runner, came across as mostly an afterthought in Wednesday’s debate. He is at risk of underperforming in Nevada on Saturday and the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29, after he flopped in Iowa and New Hampshire.For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Los fronterizos se quedaron con el boleto a las Semifinales al ganar con global de 3-1.Monarcas empezó con buenas ideas, teniendo el balón y buscando la meta de su rival; sin embargo, les costó trabajo para generar disparos a portería. La más clara la tuvieron a los 23 minutos, con un fuerte disparo de Carlos Vargas que el portero fronterizo atajó con grandes reflejos.Los caninos respondieron por medio de Erick Torres, quien se metió al área y le pegó cruzado, aunque su intento se fue por arriba de la portería. Así terminó el primer tiempo.En el complemento bajó la intensidad del encuentro, con una Monarquía que sufrió para llamar la atención en la cabaña de su rival, aunque en la recta final tuvieron la opción de acortar distancia con una pena máxima, pero Luis Malagón atajó de manera espectacular.Así terminó el partido; Tijuana ganó con global de 3-1 y se quedó con el boleto a las semifinales de la COPA MX."

Here I show you 5 lat exercises for getting a wider back by focusing on the lower lats. The key to getting sweeping lats is to not only train your back with the right exercises but by making sure you are performing them the right way.That said, if you want to build a wider back and lats you have to do two very important things in your back workouts. First, you must be willing to take the exercises you are doing through a full range of motion. Simply focusing on the middle portion of every row, pullup and pulldown is not going to give you fully developed lats just as doing this with your curls will give you fully developed biceps.Beyond that, if you don’t ever focus on creating a peak contraction of the lats by digging your elbow into your hip at the bottom of every rep, then you won’t get the muscle to grow as much as it is capable of. Each of the lat exercises shown here will help you to do exactly this. They will take your lats through a full range of motion and get you to place extra emphasis on the contracted position of the muscle.The first exercise shown is called the tripod underhand row. It is important to note that the grip makes all the difference in the effectiveness of this exercise in targeting the lats. When you perform it with an overhand grip you shift most of the focus of the move to the muscles of your upper back rather than the latissimus. When you switch to a supinated grip your elbow becomes much easier to tuck into your side, drive towards your pelvis and ultimately obtain a greater contraction of the lats in their fully shortened state.The second exercise is the wide grip underhand pulldown. This one actually helps those that struggle to feel what it should feel like to get your elbows driven into your hips. Because the movement starts with your elbows out wide, the only place for them to travel is down and in closer to your hips and pelvis. The underhand position once again helps to allow the elbows to ultimately get closer to your sides and increase the contraction of the lats.The rocking pulldown is another awesome back exercise for building wider lats because it adds the additional ability to get rotation of the torso as you drive your arm down into your side. Being able to focus on one side at a time helps those that struggle to feel a strong contraction in the lats even more.If ever there was a face pull for your lats, the high cable row would be it. This allows you once again to train one side at a time in a very athletic manner - by standing on your feet with the ability to include rotation for a v-taper back. This enables you to separate your hips from your shoulders by rotating them in opposite directions which really increases the stretch on your lats and allows for a more powerful contraction. Not just that, the up and away position of the arm creates an even more significant stretch on the lats attachments which tends to allow the user to feel a stronger contraction of the lats at the end of each rep.The incline single arm stretch pulldown is an amazing lat exercise for growing a wider back. This setup does require that you have access to an incline bench and a cable apparatus, but if you do, it’s worth the extra effort. Here you can get an amazing stretch on the lats by letting your arm drift high up overhead, with a clear target for your elbow to be driven down towards your hip on every rep. The contraction you should feel on this in your lower lats will be intense if performed correctly.Finally, there is no better lat exercise for building straight arm scapular strength than the straight arm pushdown. Performin the move one arm at a time as shown in the video. Look to not just get to the level of your back but past it to really increase the squeeze on the lower lats in the bottom position.All of these lat exercises are great for building a wider back and lats. You do not have to do all of them to get results. In fact, if you mix in one or two with your standard heavy rows, weighted pullups and deadlifts, you will notice a wider back in no time.

It’s now time to finally reach their dreams that are beautifully blooming.Furthermore, the title track, “FIESTA,” as the name implies, is expressed in a bold and glamorous manner through the image of “festivals,” depicting IZ*ONE as a group in their full bloom. If the strong passion of “La Vie en Rose” met with the lovely “Violeta” to express the group’s radiant future, “FIESTA” represents the effort to make their once dreamed of future into reality. In order to shine light on this long-awaited moment, IZ*ONE has finally blossomed through magnificent colors. With genuine hopes to fulfill their dream, IZ*ONE aims to soar higher than ever with their first studio album [BLOOM*IZ].- IZ*ONE Official Twitter : https://twitter.com/official_izone- IZ*ONE Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/official.izone- IZ*ONE Official Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/official_izone- IZ*ONE Official fancafe : http://cafe.daum.net/official-izone#BLOOM_IZ #아이즈원 #FIESTA"

If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -🎬CREDITS:DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY » Nguyễn Tân Khải CAMERA OPERATOR » Nguyễn Minh ĐứcVIDEO EDITOR » Lê Anh ĐỗPRODUCER » Liz PetersonCUBAN PRODUCTION SERVICES: i4films (IG: i4_films)LOCAL BAND: Guacacha SonCOLOR & MASTER » Quí NguyễnSelected tracks via Audio Network For business inquiries: marketing@befrs.com"

Welcome to another episode of thrift store makeovers/thrift flips. I love hunting through thrift stores to find old, rejected items and then decorating them and putting my own style on them to turn them into new pieces of art. Today I decided to use an antique clutch (satchel lol) and I decorated it using leather paints. I hope you like bright, colorful designs, and butterflies! Also, bringing back the fruit theme so get ready for that.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

Matt Reeves revealed on Twitter, this video was shot by The Batman’s cinematographer Greig Fraser and scored by the movie’s composer Michael Giacchino.While the cast for The Batman has been high caliber all around, the actual look and feel of the movie has still been a big mystery with teases ranging from Reeves posting images from Adam West's Batman '66 to Robert Pattinson teasing a more brutal, less heroic take on the character.With the star and director in place, a lot more information has since come to light. While the actual plot remains a mystery, a reported working title of “Vengeance” left some fans guessing as to what the story might be about. Plus, details that some scenes will take place in Arkham Asylum have left even more fans wondering. There is also confirmation that our hero will encounter a lot of his famous rivals during this new standalone story as well, including Riddler and Penguin.It's unknown yet where The Batman will pick up in terms of Bruce Wayne's life, but considering the working title, it's difficult not to assume that his parents death will be a primary motivation for his actions.The majority of the cast involved with The Batman have already been announced. Zoë Kravitz will step into the shoes of Selina Kyle (Catwoman), Colin Farrell will play Oswald Cobblepot (Penguin), and Paul Dano will reportedly play the main villain of the film, Edward Nashton aka Riddler. Jeffrey Wright (Westworld) has also landed the role of Commissioner Gordon.Key DC movie release dates include:Birds Of Prey (And The Fantabulous Emancipation Of One Harley Quinn) (2020)Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)The Batman (2021)The Suicide Squad (2021)Black Adam (2021)Aquaman 2 (2022)The Batman movie will swoop into theaters on June 25, 2021. Are you excited?"
