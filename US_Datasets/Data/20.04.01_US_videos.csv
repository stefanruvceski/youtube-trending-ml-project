But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"PUyKPpqY2yA","Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guard Spokesman Breaks Down Over Soleimani's Death on State TV","2020-01-03T13:57:59.000Z","UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA","QuickTake by Bloomberg","25","20.04.01","iran|trump|war|war with iran","296829","1855","1196","3898","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PUyKPpqY2yA/default.jpg","False","False","President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. airstrike that killed one of Iran‚Äôs most powerful generals and sent global markets reeling in response to the threat of an ‚Äúimminent attack,‚Äù Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said Friday.Pompeo would not provide details about the threat other than to say it was confined to the Middle East and that it justified the airstrike. Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader quickly threatened ‚Äúsevere retaliation‚Äù in response. The U.S. State Department has issued a directive urging American citizens to leave Iraq immediately due to the tensions.Oil futures in London and New York at one point surged by more than 4%, gold hit the highest in four months, 10-year Treasury yields headed for the biggest drop in three weeks and stocks and U.S. equity futures slid.Qassem Soleimani, who led proxy militias that extended Iran‚Äôs power across the Middle East, was killed in a strike in Baghdad authorized by Trump, the Defense Department said in a statement late Thursday. Trump, who is staying at Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said on Twitter Friday that ‚ÄúIran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!‚Äù and the U.S. embassy in Baghdad urged its citizens to leave the country.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt seek war with Iran,‚Äù Pompeo said in an interview on Fox Friday morning. ‚ÄúBut we, at the same time, are not going to stand by and watch the Iranians escalate and continue to put American lives at risk without responding in a way that disrupts, defends, deters and creates an opportunity to de-escalate the situation.‚Äù‚ÄúAt the direction of the president, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing‚Äù Soleimani, the Pentagon said. ‚ÄúGeneral Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.‚ÄùPompeo said the decision to strike was based on intelligence collection and that the attack ‚Äúsaved American lives.‚ÄùThe death of Soleimani, who led the Revolutionary Guards‚Äô Quds force, fueled concerns that the U.S. and Iran could be drawn into an armed confrontation that could easily pull in other countries. The pressures, which have been building for months, have been complicated by widespread protests in Iraq and Iran.‚ÄúQassem Soleimani embodied Iran‚Äôs extraterritorial activism in the Middle East,‚Äù said Asif Shuja, a senior research fellow at Singapore‚Äôs Middle East Institute. ‚ÄúHis assassination is thus bound to be a turning point.‚ÄùIran‚Äôs top leaders all condemned the attack and vowed to hit back while Foreign Minister Javad Zarif denounced the killing on Twitter as ‚Äúan act of international terrorism.‚Äù Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is due to attend an emergency meeting of Iran‚Äôs Supreme National Security Council for the first time, the state-owned Hamshahri newspaper reported. He vowed to avenge Soleimani‚Äôs killing.‚ÄúA severe retaliation awaits murderers who have the blood of Soleimani and that of other martyrs on their wicked hands from last night‚Äôs incident,‚Äù Khamenei said in a statement.The Iranian leadership is signaling that it will likely target U.S. military installations and bases in the Middle East and mobilize its network of militias across the region. One official told the state broadcaster that some 36 U.S. military bases and facilities are within reach of Iran‚Äôs defense forces, with the closest being in Bahrain. A spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards said the assassination marked the start of a ‚Äúnew phase‚Äù in the activities of Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúresistance forces‚Äù throughout the region.A September attack on Saudi oil facilities -- for which Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility -- highlighted the potential impact of Tehran‚Äôs response.Trump‚Äôs European allies urged the president to find a way to ease the tensions with Tehran and warned of the risks that a cycle of retaliations would spiral out of control.French President Emmanuel Macron is speaking to his counterparts in the Middle East in an effort to prevent the situation spiraling out of control, European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin said on RTL radio. ‚ÄúThis is what we feared,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a continuation of the escalation that‚Äôs been happening over recent months.‚ÄùGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs spokesman said the U.S. had been provoked by Iran and urged all sides to reduce the tensions.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

I surprised my dad with a new car and he did not expect it at all!  We saved over 75% off of MSRP by not buying it from the dealership! With luxury cars it's better to let someone else buy it new and take the huge depreciation hit first. Then you can buy it at an amazing price with low mileage and just a few years old. We wrapped the car with an Indulgent Blue wrap to make it look amazing and we learned how to change the oil in an exotic car to save a ton of money!*All-in-one* used car search website: https://www.AutoTempest.comWhere I got the large model car: https://amzn.to/2Q8ByxzBlue Wrap I got: https://amzn.to/39nBDoQFerrari Motor Oil: https://amzn.to/2Q71lX8Portable Socket Set: https://amzn.to/36aMj8oOil Lab Test Kit: https://www.blackstone-labs.com/Pre Purchase Inspection Checklist: https://goo.gl/uqaWYaI Finally Bought My Dream Car: https://youtu.be/Z5x22ef7A-w‚Üí As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.‚Üí Become a ChrisFix Subscriber: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=paintballoo7‚Üí Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisfixit‚Üí Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisfix8‚Üí Website: http://www.ChrisFixed.com‚Üí My Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/ChrisFix**If the video was helpful, remember to give it a thumbs up and consider subscribing.**Disclaimer:Due to factors beyond the control of ChrisFix, I cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.

Here I‚Äôm going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it‚Äôs something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn‚Äôt giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it‚Äôs doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I‚Äôm asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don‚Äôt worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don‚Äôt forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

I have put sooo much time in painting, fixing and decorating all of these. It's been a great year for creating things on my channel! Not only for squishy makeovers, but also my other thrift store finds, baking videos, create this book and other random customization projects.

I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.
