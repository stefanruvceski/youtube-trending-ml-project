In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn’t do much about it.Unless… we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, Имяя Фамилияя, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, Máté Szabó, Kasper Kylmälä, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

I'm back with another episode of squishy makeovers. This is a good one! I made some creations, I'm really proud of, I hope you guys like them just as much as I do.Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

The natural beauty, the friendliness of the people, and the amazingly flavorful food, is what makes Kerala so special. Thanks to Ebbin from Food N Travel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wTAWLHOWLYyZI9m_JV8zg) who took us on an ultimate food tour of Kerala. Can’t wait to share all of the videos with you.Kannur - We started in the North of Kerala, the Malabar Coast on the Arabian Sea. Kannur, is a friendly town, laid back, and there’s plenty of amazing street food to try.Onakkan Bharathi (Puttu Restaurant, Kannur) - We started this Indian street food tour with puttu, mutton curry, and a variety of lentils and chickpeas for breakfast. The combination was fantastic, perfect harmony of spice and flavor. The heat mostly came from black pepper. Total price - 286 INR ($4.03)Kerala crunchy snacks - Thanks to Roshan from Seashell Haris Beach Home in Kannur, for taking us to eat local snacks all drenched in chutney. I wasn’t all that excited at first for snacks in glass jugs - but the chutney blew me away. Unbelievable flavors coming out of that chutney and pickled snacks. 10 INR ($0.14) - Price per bowlStreet Mussels - Next up on this Kerala street food tour, we went to an afternoon snack stall specializing in mainly hot masala mussels, which were formed into dumpling like shapes, and fried in hot coconut oil. They were superb, as were everything else. 200 INR ($2.81) - Price for everythingChili Soda - Finally to end this food tour of Kannur, we had a soothing chili and coriander soda - they put pickled chillies and coriander in pineapple juice in a soda.

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity. It’s not a “whodunit,” it’s a “whosungit!”Preview: Season Three Is About To Be Lit | Season 3 | THE MASKED SINGERhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MaskedSingerFOX#TheMaskedSinger"

Does more expensive mean more better? And is it worth it?Donut bought two identical 350z’s and we have been modifying them to be fun, daily drivers that you can take to the track.James Pumphrey and Zach Jobe are on Team Hi, and their Z gets the expensive parts. Nolan Sykes and Aaron Parker are on Team Low, and their 350z gets the cheap parts. Afterwards, the teams test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. So far, we’ve installed coilovers and new wheel and tire combos on the 350Zs, and now we’re moving on to brakes. The ability to stop well is probably one of the more underrated features of a car. But if you’re planning some serious go-fast mods, like the turbo kits coming soon, or you want to turn yourself into a track rat, braking should be a priority. It’s just plain safer. And if you’re looking for the fastest possible laps, being able to brake harder and later means you’ll be shaving off time. So we want to see what kind of results we can get from a really basic brake upgrade versus a full super expensive brake kit. This time, Nolan and Aaron are getting a lot less total stuff for their money. Their $450 basic brake upgrade kit just comes with drilled and slotted rotors, braided stainless steel brake lines, Centric Posi Quiet brake pads for the street, and some Motul brake fluid. Low Car is keeping its stock sliding calipers, which aren’t quite as confidence-inspiring as opposed-piston calipers. Their design makes them flex more, so the pedal might not feel as good as James’ will after his brake upgrade. Hi Team is getting a full-on, 4-wheel upgrade with Wilwood 6-piston front calipers and 2-piston rear calipers, bigger 13-inch front rotors, pads, and braided stainless lines to the tune of $4400.Is more expensive more better?

I watched it myself, hoping to see the YouTube rewind of yesteryear, where it felt like a celebration of the Creator community. Alas, no. This year was so disconnected from that concept, more a top ten list than a recap of our platform's milestones. Why though? Why has this become YouTube's new norm - and yes, this is now the norm. YouTube is sending us all a message with this rewind, and all of its responses to the recent changes on the platform, that it is not one of us Creators.

One day, Beck received a message from her friend about someone she should add on social media. Beck didn't know the person, but her friend told her that if she connected with him, he would give her free money online. Beck decided to go for it - the idea of free money got her really excited. When she added the man, he started messaging her and offering her money right away. He promised to treat her right, but then he started asking her weird questions. He asked her for her shoe size, height, age - lots of personal details about Beck. Beck responded, but she gave him fake information. Then, the man asked Beck for inappropriate pictures she wasn't comfortable with. When she denied his request, he responded by saying that he would still give her the money if she sent his profile to 5 of her friends that were girls - they HAD to be girls. The promise of free money was too hard for her to pass up, so she sent his information to some friends. Some of her friends thought it was sketchy and didn't add him, but some of them did. When it was time for Beck to get the money he promised her, he asked her for her address. Then, at that moment, Beck made a big mistake - she sent him her REAL address. Beck's friends freaked out and started telling him that her address was fake, which made him extremely angry. He started sending Beck scary, threatening messages. At that point, Beck realized she made a huge mistake. Beck decided to show her school officer the messages and screen shots, and Beck's school decided to call the police. Beck was even more upset when the police told her that the man she was talking to was likely a criminal, and the whole situation was really scary for her. She regretted giving out any personal information, and the entire experience taught her what it means to stay safe online.When she looks back now, she can say to herself, A stranger offered me money on social media - and it taught me an important lesson.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

Why, for example, are the fundamental constants - like the mass of the electron or the strength of the forces - just right for the emergence of life? Tweak them too much and life, stars, galaxies, the universe as we know it wouldn’t exist. In recent episodes we explored one possible explanation for this - the anthropic principle and the idea of the multiverse. If there are countless universes with different fundamental constants, then it’s not surprising that a few exist with the right numbers for life - and certainly not surprising that we find ourselves in one of those good ones. But if you don’t like the anthropic principle - and many scientists don’t - then rest assured, there’s an alternative. You only need to accept two things: that our universe formed inside a black hole, and that universes can evolve.Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'DowdGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberSpecial Thanks to our Patreon Sponsors: Big BangAndrew & BrennaAlexander TamasCraig StonahaDavid BarnholdtDavid NicklasFabrice EapJohn SJuan BenetMorgan HoughQuasarMark HeisingVinnie FalcoHypernovaChuck ZegarDanton SpiveyDonal BotkinEdmund FokschanerHank SJohn HofmannJohn PollockJohn R.

Break it up in the pan then let it sit until a crust starts to form, then flip and do the same thing again Dice a large onion and chop it up Do the same with three cloves of garlicHeat your chili pot on medium with some olive oil then sauté the onion until it starts to brownThrow the garlic in during the last couple of minutesThen add the beef with a teaspoon of salt and break it up moreAdd in 28oz/790g crushed tomatoes2 tablespoon chili powder1 tablespoon cumin 1 to 1.5 cups beef broth…adjust as necessary ½ tablespoon of brown sugar15.5oz/439g chatty bastard kidney beansThen add hot sauce or more spice as desired. Then add toppings, which don’t count as chili ingredients, because they are on top, not inside. They’re not really a part of the chili. The chili is it’s own thing. It’s like calling ketchup a hot dog. Ketchup isn’t a hot dog. It’s ketchup. It has it’s own life. Don’t argue with me here. It will get you nowhere and it will just waste both of our times.
