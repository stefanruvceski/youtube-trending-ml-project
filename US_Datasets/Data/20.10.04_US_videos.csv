Here is a weird video we made where I mix every bath bomb from Lush together into one, single, franken-bath bomb. Just a heads up - this video was filmed a couple of months ago, pre-quarantine - I would not recommend heading to the mall right now, but I would recommend taking a nice bath, with or without some fizzing bath products. Anyway, I figured - this type of experiment has worked (within reason) for a wide array of products like lipsticks, foundations, and candles - so why not try mixing every single bath bomb from one store together to see what kind of bath we get? It's BATH makeup science. Wait, no makeup. Bad bath science? Idk.This video is NOT sponsored! We did get permission from Lush to film at their store, but we paid for all of our bath bombs!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/Check out our merch here: https://fiendsbysaf.com/MUSICVia AudioNetworkAssistant Editors: Claire Wiley & Emily Linden"

I found one from 1992 in red; it was absolutely gorgeous, low miles, and had a two-owner clean history. I went for a test drive, and that's where things fell apart. I had in my head how legendary of a car this was, but it unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations. Don't get me wrong, the NSX is quite good. The shifting is absolutely perfect, the torque curve genuinely impressed me for a relatively low powered engine, and the handling was without a doubt quite solid. However the steering and the braking left a lot to be desired, which I was shocked by, considering the manual steering rack. Perhaps I just caught a lemon, but left a bitter taste that turned me away from the car. So to my true love I went, and I absolutely love it. Check out the video for the full breakdown!

We headed to the river, to cook up Jamaican curry goat, oxtail stew, and ackee and saltfish. Turned into an epic meal, great people, and an ultimate food experience in Jamaica.We had the pleasure to hang out with Matt Robinson - The Jamaica Food Boss. He’s such a cool guy, has a huge heart for Jamaican food, and he’s so knowledgeable as well. He offers amazing food tours in Jamaica. Check them out when you’re in Montego Bay: https://www.jafoodtours.com/Sunday is family day in Jamaica and so we all headed out to the river for a Jamaican curry goat link-up! But to get there, we took a bamboo raft, something that’s known in Jamaica, and extremely fun and relaxing. It was about a 15 minute bamboo raft ride to get to the site where Matt and the Chef’s were setting up and ready to prepare this epic Jamaicna food feast.- Curry Goat - It would not be a party or a get together in Jamaica without curry goat, and it’s one of Jamaica’s best dishes.- Oxtail stew - We also made oxtail stew, a rich blend of oxtail including the meat, fat, and skin. The texture was insane.- Ackee and Saltfish - Additionally Chef made ackee and saltfish, the national food of Jamaica and easily my favorite dish of Jamaica as well. Loved it!- Peppa shrimp - And to begin this incredible meal, we started with some peppa shrimp - scotch bonnet pepper with freshwater crayfish.And outstanding day, and a Jamaican food experience I’ll never forget!Friends in the video:Matt Robinson: https://www.instagram.com/jamaicafoodboss/Joel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdohttps://www.audionetwork.com/——————————————————🍌Banana Chips are available now worldwide!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/📷Camera gear I use:https://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Three boasts a brand new group of celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The White Tiger, The Kangaroo and Miss Monster.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show.

I trust myself (I trust). I can be confident just by believing in myself.The title track “Oh my god” started from having a theme of “self-trust.” It is an Urban Hiphop track in which the stark differences in rhythm that correspond to the atmospheric changes within the song stand out. The fantasy-like mood and the bold sound led by a vintage piano sound and an 808bass are impressive. This track is something only (G)I-DLE can perform.(여자)아이들((G)I-DLE) 미니3집 [I trust]Release on 2020.04.06. 18:00 (KST)(G)I-DLE Official YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/gidleofficial(G)I-DLE Official Twitter: https://twitter.com/G_I_DLE(G)I-DLE Official Facebook: https://facebook.com/G.I.DLE.CUBE(G)I-DLE Official Instagram: https://instagram.com/official_g_i_dle(G)I-DLE Official Fansite: http://cafe.daum.net/cube-g-i-dle(G)I-DLE Official Weibo: http://weibo.com/cubegidleⓒ All Rights Reserved CUBE Entertainment Inc.#여자아이들 #GIDLE #Ohmygod"

After troubleshooting the ignition and fuel systems that plagued our last test session, we finally got to rip across the water at 90 mph and there's plenty of speed left in this beast once we get the air/fuel mixture tuned perfectly and stop the turbos from trying to melt the fiberglass boat hull. This video has lots of tips about troubleshooting V8 engines and it ends with us having the time of our lives in Game Over, our twin-turbo jet boat. Note: I live at the lake and nobody was near me when we tested the jet boat. We are staying away from people just like you are, I just happen to be fortunate enough to live in a rural part of Georgia. Anyway, thanks for watching and for liking and commenting on this video. We'll be back soon with another one!If you'd like more information about the ultrasonic parts washer that we used on the spark plugs in this video then go here: https://ultrasonicllc.com/machines/ultra-1300mGame Over is a 2017 Peterson Placecraft fiberglass Jet Boat hullIt's powered by an aluminum 711ci Sonny Leonard Hemi with twin Precision 88mm turbochargers. It features CP pistons, Carrillo connecting rods and a Bullet camshaft. T&D shaft rockers and Manley valves and springs are in the heads. The engine and boat is wired completely using Wirecare.com and Techflex products. It runs on 118 octane Rockett Brand racing fuel. The efi is from Holley, the ignition is MSD and the jet drive is a Dominator pump built by B1 Racing. I welded the headers from a kit by Stainlessheaders.com. -Finnegan"

While movies like No Time to Die and Wonder Woman 1984 can probably survive a little disruption in their release strategies, Disney depends on its MCU projects hitting their cues in order to preserve the integrity of the overarching story that links all the series and films. Thus, the bad but predictable news that came from Disney on April 3 is especially tough for Marvel Phase 4. Let's break it down.Rewinding a bit, in mid-March 2020 came the news that production on The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in Prague had been halted due to government measures in the Czech Republic intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Then, as it became clear that movie theaters wouldn't be opening back up any time soon, Disney was forced to reevaluate the upcoming release dates for some of its biggest films. Here's the rub: the changes that the Mouse House announced on April 3 don't just impact April and May movies. The effects on the MCU ripple all the way out to 2022.In film, scheduling changes often have cascading consequences. The entire release schedule is designed to avoid major conflicts. If a studio releases two tent poles on the same weekend, they run the risk of cannibalizing their own ticket sales. So when you punt one big film to a later date, it often means shifting the big movie that was originally scheduled for the second date and so on, and so on.According to Variety, Disney's new release schedule includes some major changes to Marvel Phase 4 projects, including Black Widow, The Eternals, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and the fourth Thor movie, Thor: Love and Thunder. Other big-budget family flicks like Indiana Jones 5 and Jungle Cruise have also been affected by the changes, though the shuffling of the MCU appears to be the most significant repercussion of the rescheduling for fans and Disney both.  Keep watching the video to see how the bad news just dropped for all Phase 4 MCU movies.#MCU #Phase4 #MCUPhase4Read Full Article: https://www.looper.com/199126/bad-news-just-dropped-for-all-phase-4-mcu-movies/"

This medical face mask can be sewn in 5 minutes! Great mask pattern to batch sew masks for hospitals quickly. These mask are super comfortable to wear by themselves (with or without the filter), over the top of hospital PPE masks and are made of washable materials. No elastic, no pleats to sew, have a flexible nose band and fit the face really well. No ear pain since the straps do not sit directly behind your ear-making it ideal for those 12+ hour shifts. Great beginner sewing pattern.Dimensions for kids pattern (from what I've tested) is 9 x 7-following the same directions to sew and assemble.Disclaimer: These masks are not going to prevent you from contracting any sort of respiratory illness. They are meant to be used as a temporary solution and will only provide minimal protection.

The beloved big-box store made its first food court-related membership changes in February, and now the rules are changing again to cope with the novel coronavirus pandemic. On Wednesday, April 1, Costco announced the membership policy would change to limit the number of people in the warehouse stores at one time. The decision will hopefully help create a safer environment for employees and customers as people around the world try to help curb the increase of coronavirus cases.Beginning Friday, April 3, each Costco member will only be allowed to bring one additional person inside the store. Prior to this change, Costco allowed each member to bring two guests as well as children into the stores. The brand's CEO and president released a letter stating that the company is closely watching the progression of the pandemic and working under the guidelines of public health officials. This should allow the stores to make quick and effective changes as needed.By limiting the number of people inside Costco warehouses, the move reduces the amount of face-to-face contact both customers and employees have to deal with while they're inside the building.This is just the latest change among many Costco has enacted to help protect and provide for people. The chain has also altered store hours and increased sanitation efforts, as staff members attempt to more carefully sanitize shopping cart handles, shelves, registers, and front-end belts for check-out.You might be wondering what other policy changes Costco has made in recent days. Well, we've got you covered. Like many grocers, Costco has limited the number of certain items that customers can buy. Two of the biggest items that have been limited include toilet paper and hand soap. Though the message across the country has been one advocating against hoarding or majorly stockpiling items, Costco has taken an added measure to keep individual shoppers from buying out the whole store. In some cases, the big-box store will no longer allow customers to return items that are in very high demand. This includes toilet paper, bottled water, and sanitizing wipes. Paper towels, rice, and Lysol have also made the no-return list in some stores. The company has not announced this as a nationwide change, but Today reports that several individual locations have posted signs on the no-return policy with these items listed. These changes could be in response to a couple of different reasons surrounding the novel coronavirus. It's possible that returns could be prohibited for the time being to discourage people from buying more than they need. It's also possible that Costco is trying to protect its employees from exposing themselves to the virus by handling items shoppers have already taken home and returned. While Costco has made moves to heavily revamp its sanitary practices at store locations, there are still smart practices customers should use while shopping for supplies, to reduce the chance of getting sick or spreading the disease. Good Morning America recently interviewed Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University who specializes in contagious viruses, to ask how she shops for groceries. The expert suggests visiting the grocery store as little as often, and no more than once per week. She advises people to go out at times when they believe the store will not be busy, to wipe down the cart handle, and to avoid handling too many items. She is also very careful not to touch her face while shopping. The segment reported that the pathogen does not appear to survive on cardboard for more than 24 hours or plastic for more than 72 hours, but as experts continue to learn more about this virus, advice regarding best practices for your shopping trips could change. More than anything, she is concerned about interactions with people in the aisle and the checkout, where the virus is most likely to be caught through respiratory droplets, so she uses self-checkout whenever possible. Just make sure to wash your hands as soon as you can if you do the same.
