Does more expensive mean more better? We’re gonna find out once and for all.Donut bought two identical Nissan 350z’s, and for the past few weeks have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track.Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) got a bunch of really cheap parts and in the end got  a slammed turbo z that shoots flames all for around $13,000.Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) on the other hand, got a bunch of really nice expensive stuff totaling an astounding $33,000.  Then we tested them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We’re gonna break down the cost of building these two cars, test them head to head on track, and decide which is better. Low Car got a set of eBay coilovers of unknown origin,  and Hi Car was treated to a set of KW V3s. Next, we installed wheels and tires. Hi Car got some sick Advan RGIII’s wrapped in Bridgestone RE71s. Meanwhile on the Low Car, We bought some XXR 527s, and decided to run Federal RS-RR tires. In the end, both cars were able to achieve supercar-level braking distance by switching to super sticky rubber. Nolan and Aaron installed more aggressive brake pads, steel braided brake lines, flushed and replaced the brake fluid, and bled the lines. Over on Hi Car, Zach and James replaced the car’s entire braking system with a 6 piston, 13 brake kit from Wilwood. After that we went inside our Zs, installing racing seats. The Hi Car got two Sparco QRT-R seats, a Greddy steering wheel, and a hub to make it removable. Lo Car received some Corbeau DFXs racing seats.Next, both cars were fitted with modified differentials to make sick skids easier. Hi Car got a very trick Kaaz 2-way differential. Zach spent a lot of time adjusting the spacing, making sure it was perfect. Over on Lo Car we took a different route. Instead of installing a new differential, we welded ours together!After making a bunch of performance upgrades, it was time to alter the looks of our beloved Zs. Team Low decided to give Lo Car some plastidip.Over on team Hi, they took their car to a professional vinyl shop.Finally, we gave the Donut Zs some BOOST! Hi car got a Jim Wolf  twin turbo setup that made it sound like a Baby GTR. And the low car got a single turbo kit by way of eBay.Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

We’re talking about those characters that, for one reason or another, creep you out, but are not what most would traditionally class as scary. Oh, and just to be clear, a character just being intimidating isn’t enough here. So, Terence Fletcher from “Whiplash” and Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from “Full Metal Jacket” - haa, you can’t get us! At least, for now. Our countdown includes films such as “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” (2003), “Batman Returns” (1992) & “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991).

This test, which does not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, is intended to demonstrate Crew Dragon’s ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. The six-hour test window opens at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC. A backup opportunity with the same six-hour launch window opening at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC, is available on Monday, January 20. Current weather data suggests our best opportunity for the launch escape test will be towards the end of the four-hour window, but we will continue to provide updates as new data becomes available."

In this video, I’m going to show you six exercises for your chest that you can use as a stand alone chest workout that will take just about ten minutes to complete. You will be working hard. We are going to trade in workout length and junk volume for intensity and effort.To start, you will ideally have access to a dual cable machine. If you do not and are doing this chest workout at home, you can easily substitute these out for resistance bands. The key is that the cables or bands provide an element of resisted adduction which is not found when simply using dumbbells and a bench. You want to choose a weight that you will reach failure in at the 8-10 rep mark. With only transition rest, stand up and adjust the cables up (or the bands) so that you can perform the next chest exercise in this workout; cable crossovers. Here you want to choose a 10-12 rep max and work each arm to failure. Don’t worry if you find that due to the fatigue you are only able to get out 8 or 9 reps. The key is that the drop sets are set up in such a way that it is meant to accommodate your fatigue and allow you to do some work where you wouldn’t previously be able to do any.Finally, the third exercise in this first circuit is the pushup. When doing these, you want to once again rep out until failure. The idea here is to not just push your body away from the ground but to think of it as squeezing yourself off the ground. This will engage more of the chest and work on recruiting more chest fibers as you incorporate an element of resisted adduction.This whole first drop set should take you somewhere around two and a half minutes to complete.Next, move immediately over to the second chest workout circuit.This one starts with a pair of dumbbells and the floor press exercise. Again, the weight used here should be something that challenges you and causes you to reach failure in the 8-10 rep range. Go to failure on this exercise and then pick up one of the dumbbells for the second adduction focused exercise of the workout; the Cavaliere Crossover.Perform 12 reps on each arm and then head over to the dip station for the final exercise in the workout. If you don’t have access to a dip station you can easily perform this at home in the corner of a kitchen counter. Do your dips until you reach failure and your second circuit is done. Once again, this entire circuit should take you about two and a half minutes with the entire workout clocking in around 5 minutes to this point.From here, head back to the original circuit and perform it for a second round. Do the same for the second circuit as well. If you have to adjust the weights down slightly to accommodate the mounting fatigue you may do so. Keep in mind, the most important thing you can do is keep the effort level high and take your sets to failure.At the end, you should be done in about 10-12 minutes tops. You do have the option to to through this one more round for a total of 18 high effort sets and a workout time that will barely surpass 15 minutes. The key to the effectiveness of this chest workout is that it is condensing the amount of work being done by the muscles into a shorter period of time. This type of workload can have a stimulatory effect on the muscle and lead to muscle hypertrophy through multiple mechanisms, one of which being a metabolic training benefit.Try this out and let me know how you like it.

A muscle-car drag race, obviously. And one that features over 2,200 horsepower combined. In this video, we pit these three super muscle cars against one another for quarter-mile bragging rights. Which one is the quickest? Watch to find out. Ford Mustang Shelby GT500The Shelby GT500 is a high-performance version of the Mustang coupe available in a single trim level. Essentially a track-ready, street-legal Mustang, it has many performance features not available on the standard-issue car.When you're the top horse in the stable, expectations are high. And nothing short of world-beating performance is expected of the new Mustang Shelby GT500. Since Ford ended production of the previous-generation GT500, Dodge has normalized pony-car extremes with its Challenger Hellcat variations, and Chevrolet has set new records on the crucible of test tracks, Germany's Nürburgring, with its Camaro ZL1.The Shelby GT500 appears well equipped to reassert itself as the top horse in the stable. Ford developed a new seven-speed dual-clutch transmission specifically for this engine and fitted huge 16.5-inch-diameter front brake rotors clamped upon with six-piston calipers. The adaptive suspension can adjust to various modes, including settings for track-day heroics or drag-race showdowns.Full 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500 Review: https://www.edmunds.com/ford/shelby-gt500/2020/Dodge Challenger Hellcat RedeyeThere aren't a lot of vehicles we consider to be muscle cars. The 2019 Dodge Challenger, with its outlandish horsepower and classic styling, certainly qualifies. Muscle cars are also known for their lack of practicality, but the Challenger bucks that trend by making fewer sacrifices in everyday usability thanks to its large trunk and relatively spacious rear seats.The new 797-hp SRT Hellcat Redeye is basically the retired Demon but with a slightly detuned V8 and less drag-race-specific hardware. There are also some changes in the supporting trims. All-wheel drive is now available on the base SXT, the Widebody treatment is offered on the R/T Scat Pack, and a new dual-snorkel hood increases the Hellcat output by 10 hp. Some trims also come with fewer standard features and corresponding price drops.Even without these latest changes, the Challenger would have remained one of our favorite vehicles in any class. It doesn't have the corner-carving chops of the Camaro or the Mustang, and we're quite fine with that. Not many cars have this kind of sinister style or performance that won't break the bank or overtly compromise your daily drive.The Challenger may not be as quick or as responsive as the Mustang or the Camaro, but it's always a hoot to drive. The Dodge's sheer size makes in-town maneuvering a bit tough (the wide-body fenders don't help), but the meaty tires and upgraded suspension aid handling and body roll.Full 2019 Dodge Challenger Hellcat Redeye Review: https://www.edmunds.com/dodge/challenger/2019/srt-hellcat-redeye/Chevrolet Camaro ZL1The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro has been refreshed, with new fascias, front and rear lights, and some tweaks to trim-level equipment lists. But the only quality-of-life improvement is the upgrade to Chevy's newest and quickest infotainment system, the aptly named Chevrolet Infotainment 3. Nothing that makes the Camaro a tremendous performer and rewarding car to drive has changed, but nothing that makes it an unappealing choice for daily living has changed either.Spend any time behind the wheel of a Camaro, and you'll quickly realize it's sharper and more purposeful than its American muscle-car rivals, especially when equipped with the 1LE package — an assortment of performance upgrades meant to improve handling, steering and braking. For 2019 models, Chevy has expanded the 1LE offering, making it available with all three engine options, including the turbocharged 2.0-liter.In many ways, the Camaro feels like the odd man out in the American muscle-car trinity. The Dodge Challenger has stayed true to form and is basically a rolling couch you can equip with a 797-horsepower V8, while the Ford Mustang has turned into a solid all-arounder with broad appeal for coupe buyers. But the Camaro has become a true sports car with all the ups and downs that entails, essentially abandoning all the traditional muscle-car traits except high-output V8 engines.Full 2019 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Review: https://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/camaro/2019/Subscribe to Edmunds to watch all of the latest videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/Edmundsvideo?sub_confirmation=1#ShelbyGT500 #DodgeChallenger #ChevyCamaro"

One night, he makes the mistake of drunkenly dropping an inflammatory barb on a broadcast of Skizm, an illegal death-match fight club streamed live to the public. In response, Riktor (Ned Dennehy), the maniacal mastermind behind the channel, decides to force Miles' hand (or hands, as it were) and have him join the fun. Miles wakes to find heavy pistols bolted into his bones, and learns Nix (Samara Weaving), the trigger-happy star of Skizm, is his first opponent. Gleefully echoing elements of Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the Purge franchise, and videogames like Mortal Kombat, Guns Akimbo is hilariously dark, viciously violent, and potentially — chillingly — prescient. Director Jason Lei Howden (Deathgasm) foretells of a future that may soon await us: drone-captured live feeds, UFC-like competitions pushed to an extreme, and online streaming platforms used for gladiatorial entertainment all around the world.

Fourteen-year-old Mouse (Jahi Di’Allo Winston) desperately wants to join the Midnight Clique, an infamous group of Baltimore dirt-bike riders who rule the summertime streets. His older brother, Stro, was their top rider before his tragic death—a loss that consumes Mouse as much as his passion for bikes. Mouse’s mom (Teyonah Parris) and his police mentor, Detective Rivers (William Catlett), work overtime to help the charismatic teen reach his full potential, but when the Midnight Clique’s leader, Blax (Meek Mill), takes the boy under his wing, the lure of revving his own dirt bike skids Mouse toward a road way past the straight and narrow.Puerto Rican director Angel Manuel Soto (Dinner Party, 2018 New Frontier VR experience at Sundance Film Festival) returns to the Festival with this electric feature that pulses with teen gusto, thumping hip-hop, and amazing bike tricks. Soto directs an astonishingly talented cast to create a narrative bursting with pitch-perfect performances and intoxicating emotion. Based on the documentary 12 O’Clock Boys, Charm City Kings is one boy’s unforgettable journey toward manhood.Subscribe for more official content from Meek Mill:https://MeekMill.lnk.to/subscribeFollow Meek Millhttp://meekMill.comhttp://twitter.com/MeekMillhttp://facebook.com/MeekMillhttp://instagram.com/MeekMillhttps://soundcloud.com/meek-mill-dc"
