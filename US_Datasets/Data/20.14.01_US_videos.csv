Today I'm going to be customizing 3 different iphone cases. I'm painting on phone cases with acrylic paint, using some different styles and techniques including abstract design and semi-realism. Hope you like rainbows, cute animals (or demon animals), fruit and desserts!It's been a trend recently to paint directly on the iphone, but I think I'm going to stick with the cases for now üòÇ I really want to learn more about how to customize different items and how to make painted surfaces more practical for everyday use. So if any of you have any knowledge of what kind of techniques or products I can use to prep different painting surfaces, please let me know!Also, if you guys really love any of the phone case designs, I could work on getting the design printed on actual phone cases to put in my shop!

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world‚Äôs greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb"

Meet Harley Quinn, Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain. #BirdsOfPrey in theaters 2.7.20. https://www.facebook.com/BirdsOfPreyMovie https://twitter.com/birdsofpreywb https://www.instagram.com/BirdsOfPrey/ https://www.birdsofpreymovie.com/  You ever hear the one about the cop, the songbird, the psycho and the mafia princess?  ‚ÄúBirds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)‚Äù is a twisted tale told by Harley herself, as only Harley can tell it.  When Gotham‚Äôs most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.  Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya‚Äôs paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.  In the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Margot Robbie (‚ÄúI, Tonya‚Äù) returns as Harley Quinn, alongside Mary Elizabeth Winstead (‚Äú10 Cloverfield Lane,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúFargo‚Äù) as Huntress; Jurnee Smollett-Bell (HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Blood‚Äù) as Black Canary; Rosie Perez (‚ÄúFearless,‚Äù ‚ÄúPitch Perfect 2‚Äù) as Renee Montoya; Chris Messina (‚ÄúArgo,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúSharp Objects‚Äù) as Victor Zsasz; and Ewan McGregor (upcoming ‚ÄúDoctor Sleep,‚Äù the ‚ÄúTrainspotting‚Äù films) as Roman Sionis.  Newcomer Ella Jay Basco also stars as Cassandra ‚ÄúCass‚Äù Cain in her feature film debut. Directed by Cathy Yan (‚ÄúDead Pigs‚Äù) from a script by Christina Hodson (‚ÄúBumblebee‚Äù), the film is based on characters from DC.  Robbie also produced, alongside Bryan Unkeless and Sue Kroll.  The film‚Äôs executive producers are Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, Geoff Johns, Hans Ritter and David Ayer. Joining Yan behind the scenes was a creative team comprised of director of photography Matthew Libatique (‚ÄúA Star Is Born,‚Äù ‚ÄúVenom‚Äù); production designer K.K. Barrett (‚ÄúHer‚Äù); editor Jay Cassidy (‚ÄúAmerican Hustle,‚Äù ‚ÄúSilver Linings Playbook‚Äù) and editor Evan Schiff (‚ÄúJohn Wick Chapters 2 & 3‚Äù); and costume designer Erin Benach (‚ÄúA Star Is Born‚Äù).  The music is by Daniel Pemberton (‚ÄúSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‚Äù). Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a LuckyChap Entertainment Production, a Clubhouse Pictures Production, a Kroll & Co. Entertainment Production, ‚ÄúBirds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).‚Äù  Opening in theaters and IMAX nationwide on February 7, 2020, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures."
