You might not think they‚Äôd have beef as they rarely saw each other on the court, but as Shaq moved into his role as analyst with a big personality, their adversarial relationship developed. They have a sort of a big brother-little brother relationship. Not in the sense that Shaq looked out for JaVale or anything like that, no certainly not. More in the sense of... Shaq teased JaVale until it became a real fight so vicious Mom had to step in. Seriously their moms got involved.What spurred this beef?  2.75 words: Shaqtin A FoolJaVale McGee was featured on the blooper segment more than any other player, ever. And guess what? He didn‚Äôt like that. This is a classic tale of a joke gone too far.

For fabric ties: use a strip 1‚Äùx 18-20‚Äù. Fold one short end 1/4‚Äù in and sew. Next fold the fabric strip long edges in so they meet in the center then fold in half length again. Sew down the open edge to secure. Place the tie with the raw edge next to the corners of the mask just like the elastic was. Tip: Make sure not to sew over the loose end of the tie as you sew around the mask. Kids size:  make fabric 5‚Äùx7‚Äù, and elastic 5‚Äù long.*** Please wash thoroughly after each use! **** Use tightly woven fabric, or hospital grade material.* Keep in mind men and women will be wearing the masks when choosing fabric for mask that will be donated.* Contact local health facilities to see if they are in need of donations. Currently, the supply of surgical masks is at a critical all-time low throughout the entire nation. As a community of sewists, this is a great way we can band together and make a huge difference in this time of need! While handmade fabric face masks are NOT a substitution for N95 masks, in times of emergency, the CDC may allow handmade fabric masks to be used when critical shortages take place. You can read more from the CDC here on the use of homemade masks here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.htmlAccording to the CDC website homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face. In addition to helping medical staff during critical shortages, these masks can be used at home as well. While wearing homemade face masks will not prevent against catching a respiratory illness, they can help reduce the spread of large particles when someone sneezes or coughs. *** PRODUCTS USED **** Fabric: Bonnie and Camille* Juki TL2000 Qi: https://amzn.to/2MYdOZu* Aurifil 50wt Thread: https://amzn.to/33gN1Af* Oliso Pro Smart Iron: https://amzn.to/2ZbppJE* Scissors: https://amzn.to/2tvesWm* Wonder Clips: https://amzn.to/2tr1s4e*** QUILT on the Wall Behind me ***Vintage Spring Quilt Pattern: http://bit.ly/2IMAGw2**** Shop ERICA'S SEWING FAVORITES Here! **** https://www.amazon.com/shop/ericaarndt****  FIND ME HERE **** Email me: erica@confessionsofahomeschooler.comeCourses: http://go.confessionsofahomeschooler.comWebsite: http://www.confessionsofahomeschooler.comStore: http://store.confessionsofahomeschooler.com/COAH Homeschool Community: https://community.confessionsofahomeschooler.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ericaarndt/ YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/EricasHomeschoolFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConfessionsofaHomeschoolerTwitter: http://twitter.com/ericahomeschoolPinterest: http://pinterest.com/ericahomeschoolRavelry: https://www.ravelry.com/people/EricaArndt****  ****  **** Disclosure: This is not a sponsored video.

Given the current and evolving situation involving COVID-19, please continue to practice social distancing, stay informed about and comply with local guidelines, and we look forward to working out together someday soon. Kevin Hart wants to motivate an entire city to get healthy, so with the help of David Dobrik, they put out a call for over 1,000 fans to meet up for a community fitness event. The third season of What The Fit starring Kevin Hart follows Kevin and a new squad of famous friends as they continue to inspire the world to work out. They‚Äôll take on the courts of the Harlem Globetrotters, organize a community workout for the entire city, and keep in step with a high school marching band. How much success they‚Äôll have with any of these things is up for debate, but one thing they‚Äôve proved time and time again, is that nothing is too bold, too outrageous or too ridiculous for Kevin and his guests if it can get the world on its feet.FOLLOW THE FUNNY:Facebook‚ñ∂ http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-FBTwitter‚ñ∂ http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-TWInstagram‚ñ∂ http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-IGYouTube‚ñ∂ https://www.youtube.com/user/HartBeatProductionsSnapchat‚ñ∂ LOLNetworkOfficial Website‚ñ∂ http://www.laughoutloud.com Laugh Out Loud is a comedy brand and multi-platform network founded by the world‚Äôs top comedian Kevin Hart.

In this video, I‚Äôm going to give you a complete home workout routine with all sets and reps included to help you to build muscle regardless of whether or not you ever step foot in a gym. The key to the effectiveness of this perfect home workout is that it pairs exercises together in a way that allows you to train to greater overload than would be possible if you stuck with one single exercise, and it will keep the workouts brief at the same time.This perfect home workout consists of not one but two complete total body workouts. The first, workout A, is to be performed on Monday and Friday of week 1. Workout B is to be performed on Wednesday. In week 2, this is flipped so that A is performed once on Wednesday and B is performed on both Monday and Friday. You can continue to alternate the workouts in this way if you decide to do this for longer.This workout for home is going to allow you to hit your total body in under one hour.With this being the goal, the idea is not to try and hit each muscle with too many individual exercises since this could lead to an excessively long workout and potential for doing too much in the given workout. Instead, we select the exercises based on movement patterns that we know we want to hit to accomplish our goal of building muscle everywhere.These patterns are broken down below and the exercises included in each are shown.Keep in mind, there are two complete versions of each workout to be sure that the beginners and more advanced trainees can follow this program and get results from it.Here is how to construct the perfect home total body workout A:1. SQUAT / ANTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Alt. Single Leg Box Squats (use low box if advanced / higher box for beginners)1 1/2 Bottomed Out Squats (to failure)Jump Squats2. UPPER PUSH (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Handstand Pushups OR Power PushawaysRotational Pushups OR Knee Rotational PushupsCobra Pushups (long head contracted) OR Knee Cobra Pushups3. HINGE / POSTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Alt. Single Leg Heel Touch Squats (use ‚Äúkickstand‚Äù if needed)Alt. Sprinter Lunges Plyo Sprinter Lunges (jump from higher position if more beginner)4. UPPER PULL (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Pullups OR Seated PullupsHuman Pullovers OR BW Sliding PulldownsInverted Chin Curls5. ABS (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Reverse CorkscrewsBlack Widow Knee SlidesLevitation Crunches6. CORRECTIVE (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Angels and DevilsCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)Here is how to construct the perfect home workout B:HINGE / POSTERIOR x 3 ROUNDSSlick Floor Bridge Curl (Single Leg) OR Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Dual Leg)Long Leg MarchHigh Hip BucksLUNGE / ANTERIOR x 3 ROUNDSAlt. Crossover Step UpsAlt. Reverse LungesSplit Squat JumpsUPPER PUSH x 3 ROUNDSVariable Wall Pushups OR Knee Decline Pushups to Knee Flat PushupsAlt. BW Side Lateral Raises (from knees for beginners)Tricep BW Extensions (long head stretch)UPPER PULL x 3 ROUNDSChin Ups OR Seated Chin UpsInverted RowsBack WidowsABS x 2 ROUNDSAb HalosV-Up TucksSit-Up Elbow ThrustsCORRECTIVE x 2 ROUNDSReverse HypersCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)If you are doing this workout just to try it out, then I would suggest you choose the workout A variation. That said, if you opt to do a more comprehensive total body split workout routine then you will want to either incorporate workouts A and B into a twice a week plan or, even better, alternating A and B on M, W and F each week.For a complete 6 week home workout plan, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below to get the athlean xero program.

He said countries must increase testing and isolate those who test positive, as well as close contacts, stressing their key message is test, test, test.Ghebreyesus added that as some countries have exceeded their capacities to care for patients with mild symptoms and they should focus on more severe cases and prioritize those with underlying conditions. He said mild cases could be isolated at home and gave directions on safety procedures on how to take care of patients at home, including sleeping in a different bedroom, using a different bathroom, and wearing protective masks.The director-general called COVID-19 the defining global health crisis of our time, and that fighting it would be a test of trust in science and in solidarity. He said moments like people applauding health workers in places like Italy shows the type of human solidarity that should become more infectious than the disease.***Please note that this press conference is virtual. ***For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6683518/who-testing-coronavirus-march-16/Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GlobalNews #COVID19 #Coronavirus"
