But he’s also a pragmatist.“The reality is also that in the coming period a large part of the population will be infected with the virus, he added.So unlike the Italians or the French, the Dutch are not on lockdown. Schools and restaurants have been told to close, but strict social distancing hasn’t been imposed. People are still hanging out in parks. Even the coffee shops that sell weed are open, though now only for to-go orders.The owner of one coffee shop in Tilburg, who goes by his nickname Meuk, told VICE News that in times like these, establishments like his are vital because they help people keep calm.

Click here: https://www.npr.org/tinydeskFollow NPR Music:Twitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusicInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusicMarch 16, 2020 | Lyndsey McKenna and Marissa Lorusso -- Like many who have graced the Tiny Desk before him, the awkwardness of performing in a working office wasn't lost on Harry Styles. It just feels like you're in the way, he joked. But when you watch his set from behind Bob Boilen's desk, you'd never suspect any discomfort.Backed by his touring band, Styles performed several songs from his latest solo album, Fine Line. Between tracks, he talked about the process of writing these songs: From the day off in Nashville that led to Watermelon Sugar, to the feeling of lovesickness he tried to capture in Adore You. The camaraderie between the band was clear; and Styles was in on the joy, twirling in his seat between verses.Styles might not necessarily be the first name that comes to mind when you think of public radio's only working, desk-music-discovery platform. After all, he's got a wildly devoted fanbase that's followed his every move since his One Direction days. In fact, before soundcheck had even started, a crowd of fans had begun to gather outside NPR HQ. They rightly suspected he would be playing a Tiny Desk concert after word got out that the former One Directioner was spotted in D.C. with no tour date on his public schedule.But beyond the headlines, Styles has proven to be an artist who takes his songcraft and aesthetic seriously, interested in subverting expectations of what a pop star can and should sound like in 2020. That sense of unpretentious creativity is exactly what he brought to his Tiny Desk performance – and it definitely earned him some new adoring public radio fans in the process.I have to come into NPR more often, Styles said after he and his band played their first song. It's nice here.We — and our massive crowd of colleagues — couldn't agree more.SET LISTCherryWatermelon SugarTo Be So LonelyAdore YouMUSICIANSHarry Styles: vocals, guitar; Sarah Jones: drums, vocals; Mitch Rowland: guitar; Adam Prendergast: bass, vocals; Ny Oh: guitar, vocals; Charlotte Clark: piano, Wurlitzer, guitar, vocalsCREDITSProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Kara Frame, CJ Riculan, Melany Rochester, Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Max Posner/NPR"

This isn’t the crisp-skinned, high-heat roast chicken you’re probably familiar with. Instead, it’s a melt-in-your-mouth tender, schmaltzy, slow-roast version that’s more similar to rotisserie chicken—except (bonus!) it gets slathered in the funky-spicy-sweet gochujang. And while the meat might be the star of the show, don't discount those buttery-soft, nearly-confited potatoes, which cook gently in the chicken fat. Makes you wonder why you haven't always been roasting long-cooking vegetables—carrots, cauliflower, turnips (?!), winter squash, fennel—under the bird for a built-in side, huh?Check out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/slow-roast-gochujang-chickenFilmed on November 4, 2019.Want Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promoStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPnWant more Bon Appétit in your life?

For fabric ties: use a strip 1”x 18-20”. Fold one short end 1/4” in and sew. Next fold the fabric strip long edges in so they meet in the center then fold in half length again. Sew down the open edge to secure. Place the tie with the raw edge next to the corners of the mask just like the elastic was. Tip: Make sure not to sew over the loose end of the tie as you sew around the mask. Kids size:  make fabric 5”x7”, and elastic 5” long.*** Please wash thoroughly after each use! **** Use tightly woven fabric, or hospital grade material.* Keep in mind men and women will be wearing the masks when choosing fabric for mask that will be donated.* Contact local health facilities to see if they are in need of donations. Currently, the supply of surgical masks is at a critical all-time low throughout the entire nation. As a community of sewists, this is a great way we can band together and make a huge difference in this time of need! While handmade fabric face masks are NOT a substitution for N95 masks, in times of emergency, the CDC may allow handmade fabric masks to be used when critical shortages take place. You can read more from the CDC here on the use of homemade masks here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.htmlAccording to the CDC website homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face. In addition to helping medical staff during critical shortages, these masks can be used at home as well. While wearing homemade face masks will not prevent against catching a respiratory illness, they can help reduce the spread of large particles when someone sneezes or coughs. *** PRODUCTS USED **** Fabric: Bonnie and Camille* Juki TL2000 Qi: https://amzn.to/2MYdOZu* Aurifil 50wt Thread: https://amzn.to/33gN1Af* Oliso Pro Smart Iron: https://amzn.to/2ZbppJE* Scissors: https://amzn.to/2tvesWm* Wonder Clips: https://amzn.to/2tr1s4e*** QUILT on the Wall Behind me ***Vintage Spring Quilt Pattern: http://bit.ly/2IMAGw2**** Shop ERICA'S SEWING FAVORITES Here! **** https://www.amazon.com/shop/ericaarndt****  FIND ME HERE **** Email me: erica@confessionsofahomeschooler.comeCourses: http://go.confessionsofahomeschooler.comWebsite: http://www.confessionsofahomeschooler.comStore: http://store.confessionsofahomeschooler.com/COAH Homeschool Community: https://community.confessionsofahomeschooler.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ericaarndt/ YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/EricasHomeschoolFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConfessionsofaHomeschoolerTwitter: http://twitter.com/ericahomeschoolPinterest: http://pinterest.com/ericahomeschoolRavelry: https://www.ravelry.com/people/EricaArndt****  ****  **** Disclosure: This is not a sponsored video.

They have a sort of a big brother-little brother relationship. Not in the sense that Shaq looked out for JaVale or anything like that, no certainly not. More in the sense of... Shaq teased JaVale until it became a real fight so vicious Mom had to step in.

Jimmy also talks about online comments regarding his appearance, Trump lashing out at NBC’s Peter Alexander, Sean Spicer showing up at the press briefing, some Senators selling off massive amounts of stock shortly after a Coronavirus briefing, the toilet paper crisis, and most of Las Vegas shutting down. During times like these, it’s also good to check in on old friends, so Jimmy talks to Brandon Flowers and Ronnie Vannucci of The Killers via webchat, and they perform “Caution from their new album “Imploding The Mirage.

Given the current and evolving situation involving COVID-19, please continue to practice social distancing, stay informed about and comply with local guidelines, and we look forward to working out together someday soon. Kevin Hart wants to motivate an entire city to get healthy, so with the help of David Dobrik, they put out a call for over 1,000 fans to meet up for a community fitness event. The third season of What The Fit starring Kevin Hart follows Kevin and a new squad of famous friends as they continue to inspire the world to work out. They’ll take on the courts of the Harlem Globetrotters, organize a community workout for the entire city, and keep in step with a high school marching band. How much success they’ll have with any of these things is up for debate, but one thing they’ve proved time and time again, is that nothing is too bold, too outrageous or too ridiculous for Kevin and his guests if it can get the world on its feet.FOLLOW THE FUNNY:Facebook▶ http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-FBTwitter▶ http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-TWInstagram▶ http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-IGYouTube▶ https://www.youtube.com/user/HartBeatProductionsSnapchat▶ LOLNetworkOfficial Website▶ http://www.laughoutloud.com Laugh Out Loud is a comedy brand and multi-platform network founded by the world’s top comedian Kevin Hart.

Over the coming weeks, customers with flight itineraries that need to be adjusted will be contacted by JetBlue via email.

Falcon 9’s first stage supported the Iridium-7 NEXT mission in July 2018, the SAOCOM 1A mission in October 2018, the Nusantara Satu mission in February 2019, and the second launch of Starlink in November 2019. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. Falcon 9’s fairing previously supported the first launch of Starlink in May 2019. Approximately 45 minutes after liftoff, SpaceX’s fairing recovery vessels, “Ms. Tree” and “Ms. Chief,” will attempt to recover the two fairing halves."

In this video, I’m going to give you a complete home workout routine with all sets and reps included to help you to build muscle regardless of whether or not you ever step foot in a gym. The key to the effectiveness of this perfect home workout is that it pairs exercises together in a way that allows you to train to greater overload than would be possible if you stuck with one single exercise, and it will keep the workouts brief at the same time.This perfect home workout consists of not one but two complete total body workouts. The first, workout A, is to be performed on Monday and Friday of week 1. Workout B is to be performed on Wednesday. In week 2, this is flipped so that A is performed once on Wednesday and B is performed on both Monday and Friday. You can continue to alternate the workouts in this way if you decide to do this for longer.This workout for home is going to allow you to hit your total body in under one hour.With this being the goal, the idea is not to try and hit each muscle with too many individual exercises since this could lead to an excessively long workout and potential for doing too much in the given workout. Instead, we select the exercises based on movement patterns that we know we want to hit to accomplish our goal of building muscle everywhere.These patterns are broken down below and the exercises included in each are shown.Keep in mind, there are two complete versions of each workout to be sure that the beginners and more advanced trainees can follow this program and get results from it.Here is how to construct the perfect home total body workout A:1. SQUAT / ANTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Alt. Single Leg Box Squats (use low box if advanced / higher box for beginners)1 1/2 Bottomed Out Squats (to failure)Jump Squats2. UPPER PUSH (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Handstand Pushups OR Power PushawaysRotational Pushups OR Knee Rotational PushupsCobra Pushups (long head contracted) OR Knee Cobra Pushups3. HINGE / POSTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Alt. Single Leg Heel Touch Squats (use “kickstand” if needed)Alt. Sprinter Lunges Plyo Sprinter Lunges (jump from higher position if more beginner)4. UPPER PULL (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Pullups OR Seated PullupsHuman Pullovers OR BW Sliding PulldownsInverted Chin Curls5. ABS (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Reverse CorkscrewsBlack Widow Knee SlidesLevitation Crunches6. CORRECTIVE (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Angels and DevilsCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)Here is how to construct the perfect home workout B:HINGE / POSTERIOR x 3 ROUNDSSlick Floor Bridge Curl (Single Leg) OR Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Dual Leg)Long Leg MarchHigh Hip BucksLUNGE / ANTERIOR x 3 ROUNDSAlt. Crossover Step UpsAlt. Reverse LungesSplit Squat JumpsUPPER PUSH x 3 ROUNDSVariable Wall Pushups OR Knee Decline Pushups to Knee Flat PushupsAlt.

That said, if you opt to do a more comprehensive total body split workout routine then you will want to either incorporate workouts A and B into a twice a week plan or, even better, alternating A and B on M, W and F each week.For a complete 6 week home workout plan, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below to get the athlean xero program.
