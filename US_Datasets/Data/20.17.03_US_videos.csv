That means the disease no longer constitutes just an outbreak or even an epidemic; the coronavirus has now spread around the world, and will continue to reach into other countries and communities.That‚Äôs in part because of how contagious the virus is. When you‚Äôre infected with the flu, it takes about two days before you start to show symptoms. But coronavirus symptoms take an average of five to six days to appear, so it‚Äôs easy to spread well before you notice that you‚Äôre feeling sick. Many people are spreading it while going about their daily lives as usual.The risk is that once coronavirus starts to spread in a community, about 20% of cases are severe and may require hospitalization. As those cases multiply, hospitals can fill up quickly. And people with severe cases of COVID-19 who can‚Äôt receive proper medical attention are at a much higher risk of dying.Ideally, we would be able to stop the virus from spreading entirely. We can‚Äôt do that right now. What we can do is slow it down, so that the severe cases get spread out over a longer period of time, and hospitals are less likely to be overwhelmed on any given day. And that‚Äôs where each one of us comes in. The best way to slow down the spread is for everyone ‚Äî healthy, sick, young, old ‚Äî to limit social contact as much as possible, immediately. This is called social distancing, and it only works if enough of us do it. But if we do, it could mean the difference between the life and death of someone you know.Read more on Vox: How social distancing and ‚Äúflattening the curve‚Äù works:  http://bit.ly/3aOlHM8The math behind social distancing: http://bit.ly/3a78wG8The rules of social distancing: http://bit.ly/2xDoZnbHow does the coronavirus outbreak end?

He said countries must increase testing and isolate those who test positive, as well as close contacts, stressing their key message is test, test, test.Ghebreyesus added that as some countries have exceeded their capacities to care for patients with mild symptoms and they should focus on more severe cases and prioritize those with underlying conditions. He said mild cases could be isolated at home and gave directions on safety procedures on how to take care of patients at home, including sleeping in a different bedroom, using a different bathroom, and wearing protective masks.The director-general called COVID-19 the defining global health crisis of our time, and that fighting it would be a test of trust in science and in solidarity. He said moments like people applauding health workers in places like Italy shows the type of human solidarity that should become more infectious than the disease.***Please note that this press conference is virtual. ***For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6683518/who-testing-coronavirus-march-16/Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GlobalNews #COVID19 #Coronavirus"

Authorities here have decided to close borders with Switzerland and Austria. That's according to German media reports. Added restrictions are also being imposed on the French-German boundary. Spain is in lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus Covid-19. Unprecedented lockdowns and border closures are coming into effect in many European countries, and the streets are empty throughout Europe, with Spain and France among the worst hit by the virus' spread behind Italy. England is planning self-isolation measures for all people over 70, for up to four months. Austria's Chancellor Sebstian Kurz says his government is banning gatherings of more than five people. Iran's coronavirus death toll has leapt by 113 in one day to reach 724. And the Vatican says all Easter services will take place without worshipers in attendance. Pope Francis will hold Sunday blessings via TV and the internet. Meanwhile, the United States has tightened its ban on visitors from Europe. President Donald Trump says it will now include travelers from Britain and Ireland. In countries that are far away from coronavirus hotspots, like Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, the response from authorities has ranged from tough to nonexistent.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dw_stories/F√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#Coronavirus #Covid19 #dwNews"

He sees his music as therapeutic, not just for him, but for anyone who comes in contact with it.As genuine a modern day outlaw as you can get, Jelly's music incorporates influences ranging from Southern Rock to Dirty South rap. With his forthcoming album, A Beautiful Disaster, Jelly Roll draws you in with his ability to tell a story that you didn't even know you were a part of. With songs like Creature, I Need You, Nothing Left At All and the dark, haunting love story Suicide along with features from the likes of Tech N9ne, Struggle Jennings, Krizz Kaliko and Lil Wyte, A Beautiful Disaster gives you a direct link to the life of Jelly Roll - the trials and tribulations, along with the celebrations and victories."

Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.While this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.

The food, people, culture, and ancient bazaar were all the highlights. In this video, we take you on a Iranian street food tour of the ancient bazaar of Tabriz. #Iran #Tabriz #streetfoodBazaar of Tabriz - A UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East, it‚Äôs also one of the best preserved and most authentic. What was amazing to me is how it‚Äôs still in full functioning use, still used in much of the same exact way as its been used for hundreds of years. There are sections of the bazaar for everything - from spices and food, clothes and woodwork. But one of the most fascinating parts of the bazaar is the carpets bazaar, where you‚Äôll find some of the best hand made Persian carpets in the world. Tabriz is known around the world for its exquisite carpet making.Tabriz Central Mosque - Bazaar of Tabriz - In addition to the amazing Iranian food, we also visited the Tabriz Central Mosque.Haj Ali Kebab - One of the most famous and best restaurants in Tabriz is Haj Ali Kebab, where you‚Äôll find some of the best kebabs in Tabriz. The kebabs were so incredibly juicy, especially with Persian style butter rice, and some roasted tomatoes and sumac. It was a wonderful lunch within the ancient bazaar.Shazdeh Restaurant - Along with plenty of street food snacks, our final Iranian food meal at the bazaar was at Shazdeh Restaurant, and one dish you can‚Äôt miss are the kufta Tabrizi, one of the ultimate dishes of Tabriz.It was an amazing day, and a throwback in time, learning about and discovering the ancient bazaar of Tabriz, Iran!Thank you to Ghasr Setareh (https://www.instagram.com/ghasr_setareh/) for arranging our trip to Iran.Friends in the video:Mr. Taster: https://www.instagram.com/mr.taster/Persia Tour Guide: https://www.instagram.com/persiatourguide/Rambod: https://www.instagram.com/rambod_rastegar/Ali: https://www.instagram.com/alimojarad/üéµMUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdohttps://www.audionetwork.com/‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîüçåBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiensüëïGet t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/üì∑Camera gear I use:https://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîüì±FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"
