The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb"

Meet Harley Quinn, Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain. #BirdsOfPrey in theaters 2.7.20. https://www.facebook.com/BirdsOfPreyMovie https://twitter.com/birdsofpreywb https://www.instagram.com/BirdsOfPrey/ https://www.birdsofpreymovie.com/  You ever hear the one about the cop, the songbird, the psycho and the mafia princess?  “Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)” is a twisted tale told by Harley herself, as only Harley can tell it.  When Gotham’s most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.  Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya’s paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.  In the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Margot Robbie (“I, Tonya”) returns as Harley Quinn, alongside Mary Elizabeth Winstead (“10 Cloverfield Lane,” TV’s “Fargo”) as Huntress; Jurnee Smollett-Bell (HBO’s “True Blood”) as Black Canary; Rosie Perez (“Fearless,” “Pitch Perfect 2”) as Renee Montoya; Chris Messina (“Argo,” TV’s “Sharp Objects”) as Victor Zsasz; and Ewan McGregor (upcoming “Doctor Sleep,” the “Trainspotting” films) as Roman Sionis.  Newcomer Ella Jay Basco also stars as Cassandra “Cass” Cain in her feature film debut. Directed by Cathy Yan (“Dead Pigs”) from a script by Christina Hodson (“Bumblebee”), the film is based on characters from DC.  Robbie also produced, alongside Bryan Unkeless and Sue Kroll.  The film’s executive producers are Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, Geoff Johns, Hans Ritter and David Ayer. Joining Yan behind the scenes was a creative team comprised of director of photography Matthew Libatique (“A Star Is Born,” “Venom”); production designer K.K. Barrett (“Her”); editor Jay Cassidy (“American Hustle,” “Silver Linings Playbook”) and editor Evan Schiff (“John Wick Chapters 2 & 3”); and costume designer Erin Benach (“A Star Is Born”).  The music is by Daniel Pemberton (“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”). Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a LuckyChap Entertainment Production, a Clubhouse Pictures Production, a Kroll & Co. Entertainment Production, “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).”  Opening in theaters and IMAX nationwide on February 7, 2020, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures."

Is the wrap worth the cost? We bought two identical 350Zs and have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track. James Pumphrey and Zach Jobe are on Team Hi, and their car gets the expensive parts. Nolan Sykes and Aaron Parker are on team Low. Their car gets the cheap ones.Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on.If you want to “paint” or change the color of your car, you basically have three options- A traditional paint job, a vinyl wrap, or plastidip. The gloss of a paint job is intoxicating, but a perfect paint job like that is not only ridonkulously expensive, but it takes forever. There is so much prep work involved with a paint job like!So Hi Team is taking the happy medium route: they're getting Hi Car professionally vinyl wrapped. $2600 bucks. A quality wrap job is the best of every world. Hardly any prep work. It only takes a few days to get one done, though if you’re doing it yourself, put your patience-pants on. It protects your paint --if it’s worth protecting, it’s totally reversible --for when you change your mind, and you can have any sort of graphic screen printed onto a vinyl wrap. Team Low will be plastidipping their car by hand. Plasti dip offers many of the same benefits as vinyl-wrapping, but for a fraction of the price. We bought this plasti dip kit from “dip your car” for $500. It is California compliant, so that might make it worse. But on the bright side, it is relatively easy to do yourself (or so Nolan thought), there’s very little prep work, it’s totally reversible, and it’s easy to fix damage or mistakes. The only downsides are that it’s never going to look like a great paint job, it’s not that durable, and Team Low has to do it themselvesDoes it look $2000 better?

The Golden Globes serve as the official kickoff to the 2020 awards season. Twenty-five categories - 14 in film and 11 in television - are voted on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). The Golden Globe Awards, often referred to as “Hollywood’s Party of the Year™,” is one of the biggest nights on the calendar for live viewing. It’s also one of the few awards shows that combines the honorees of both film and television.Ricky Gervais' Monologue - 2020 Golden Globeshttps://youtu.be/LCNdTLHZAeoNBC on YouTubehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc"

But what really got me were the emotional moments. I kid you not, I shed a couple tears tonight!What’s up? It’s Drew Dorsey here with Clevver News and award season is officially underway!There were so many moments to talk about, but I’m here to talk about the tear jerking moments. And grab your tissues because emotions were running high!Let’s start with Tom Hanks who was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille award.It was a huge honor and just the montage before his acceptance speech was enough to get me emotional. But his speech set me over the edge.When he thanked his wife there wasn’t a dry eye in the audience or at home. You have to see it for yourself.I mean, my heart can’t take it! And neither could fans on Twitter.One person said quote, “HARD TO NOT CRY WHEN TOM HANKS CRIES.”And another said quote, “I MEAN. WOW. #TomHanks is a worldwide treasure and we need to protect him at all costs. Also, excuse me while I wipe up the entire lake of tears I shed during his speech. @tomhanks”BRB still crying over this entire moment.And if that wasn’t enough to make you shed a tear, let’s talk about Kate McKinnon presenting Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award.She opened up about how Ellen made her feel comfortable with her sexuality and how she’s paved the way for many people in the LGBTQ+ community in Hollywood.And fans are really connecting with this moment as well.One person tweeted saying quote, “I became super emotional watching Ellen DeGeneres--that people sought to dim her light is unacceptable. All I can say is, Equality is non-negotiable. And @RepHartzler --your discriminatory + hateful views on the LGBTQ+ community have no place in Congress.”And another said quote, “It was amazing, and so was Kate Mckinnon’s introduction. It was just what I needed today. The world needs more Ellen’s.”And we couldn’t agree more!The last emotional moment we will talk about for today, because I don’t want you all crying too much, is Jennifer Anniston talking about the Australian fires.Many celebs brought attention to the tragic fires that are currently happening in Australia.Jenn read Russell Crowe’s acceptance speech for him because he is back home in Australia helping his family affected by the fires.She got choked up when reading it and fans talked about this moment on Twitter.One fan tweeted saying quote, “No, YOU were getting emotional watching Jennifer Aniston fighting off tears reading Russell Crowe's acceptance speech on the Australia fires.”And another said quote, “Jennifer Aniston did a superb job hosting and reading out Russel Crowe’s message with sincerity and empathy”And we totally get it. The fires are tragic and we’d like to help however we can.In our description we’ve linked some ways to donate and get involved. Please consider donating if you are able to!And I want to hear from you all which moment made you cry the most.Was it Tom Hanks or Kate McKinnon or someone else?Let me know down in the comments below.After that, why don’t you dive in to more Clevver News by hitting that subscribe button and click that bell so you don’t miss any of our new stories.
