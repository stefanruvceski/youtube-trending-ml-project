Wolf Cukier, 17, discovered a planet that is 1,300 light years away and seven times larger than Earth. Cukier is a senior at Scarsdale High School in New York, and while he expected his internship to be exciting, he had no idea it would be this exciting.

Meet Harley Quinn, Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain. #BirdsOfPrey in theaters 2.7.20. https://www.facebook.com/BirdsOfPreyMovie https://twitter.com/birdsofpreywb https://www.instagram.com/BirdsOfPrey/ https://www.birdsofpreymovie.com/  You ever hear the one about the cop, the songbird, the psycho and the mafia princess?  “Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)” is a twisted tale told by Harley herself, as only Harley can tell it.  When Gotham’s most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.  Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya’s paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.  In the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Margot Robbie (“I, Tonya”) returns as Harley Quinn, alongside Mary Elizabeth Winstead (“10 Cloverfield Lane,” TV’s “Fargo”) as Huntress; Jurnee Smollett-Bell (HBO’s “True Blood”) as Black Canary; Rosie Perez (“Fearless,” “Pitch Perfect 2”) as Renee Montoya; Chris Messina (“Argo,” TV’s “Sharp Objects”) as Victor Zsasz; and Ewan McGregor (upcoming “Doctor Sleep,” the “Trainspotting” films) as Roman Sionis.  Newcomer Ella Jay Basco also stars as Cassandra “Cass” Cain in her feature film debut. Directed by Cathy Yan (“Dead Pigs”) from a script by Christina Hodson (“Bumblebee”), the film is based on characters from DC.  Robbie also produced, alongside Bryan Unkeless and Sue Kroll.  The film’s executive producers are Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, Geoff Johns, Hans Ritter and David Ayer. Joining Yan behind the scenes was a creative team comprised of director of photography Matthew Libatique (“A Star Is Born,” “Venom”); production designer K.K. Barrett (“Her”); editor Jay Cassidy (“American Hustle,” “Silver Linings Playbook”) and editor Evan Schiff (“John Wick Chapters 2 & 3”); and costume designer Erin Benach (“A Star Is Born”).  The music is by Daniel Pemberton (“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”). Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a LuckyChap Entertainment Production, a Clubhouse Pictures Production, a Kroll & Co. Entertainment Production, “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).”  Opening in theaters and IMAX nationwide on February 7, 2020, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures."

Is the wrap worth the cost? We bought two identical 350Zs and have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track. James Pumphrey and Zach Jobe are on Team Hi, and their car gets the expensive parts. Nolan Sykes and Aaron Parker are on team Low. Their car gets the cheap ones.Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on.If you want to “paint” or change the color of your car, you basically have three options- A traditional paint job, a vinyl wrap, or plastidip. The gloss of a paint job is intoxicating, but a perfect paint job like that is not only ridonkulously expensive, but it takes forever. There is so much prep work involved with a paint job like!So Hi Team is taking the happy medium route: they're getting Hi Car professionally vinyl wrapped. $2600 bucks. A quality wrap job is the best of every world. Hardly any prep work. It only takes a few days to get one done, though if you’re doing it yourself, put your patience-pants on. It protects your paint --if it’s worth protecting, it’s totally reversible --for when you change your mind, and you can have any sort of graphic screen printed onto a vinyl wrap. Team Low will be plastidipping their car by hand. Plasti dip offers many of the same benefits as vinyl-wrapping, but for a fraction of the price. We bought this plasti dip kit from “dip your car” for $500. It is California compliant, so that might make it worse. But on the bright side, it is relatively easy to do yourself (or so Nolan thought), there’s very little prep work, it’s totally reversible, and it’s easy to fix damage or mistakes.

The Golden Globes serve as the official kickoff to the 2020 awards season. Twenty-five categories - 14 in film and 11 in television - are voted on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). The Golden Globe Awards, often referred to as “Hollywood’s Party of the Year™,” is one of the biggest nights on the calendar for live viewing. It’s also one of the few awards shows that combines the honorees of both film and television.Ricky Gervais' Monologue - 2020 Golden Globeshttps://youtu.be/LCNdTLHZAeoNBC on YouTubehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc"

But what really got me were the emotional moments. I kid you not, I shed a couple tears tonight!What’s up? It’s Drew Dorsey here with Clevver News and award season is officially underway!There were so many moments to talk about, but I’m here to talk about the tear jerking moments. And grab your tissues because emotions were running high!Let’s start with Tom Hanks who was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille award.It was a huge honor and just the montage before his acceptance speech was enough to get me emotional. But his speech set me over the edge.When he thanked his wife there wasn’t a dry eye in the audience or at home. You have to see it for yourself.I mean, my heart can’t take it! And neither could fans on Twitter.One person said quote, “HARD TO NOT CRY WHEN TOM HANKS CRIES.”And another said quote, “I MEAN. WOW. #TomHanks is a worldwide treasure and we need to protect him at all costs. Also, excuse me while I wipe up the entire lake of tears I shed during his speech. @tomhanks”BRB still crying over this entire moment.And if that wasn’t enough to make you shed a tear, let’s talk about Kate McKinnon presenting Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award.She opened up about how Ellen made her feel comfortable with her sexuality and how she’s paved the way for many people in the LGBTQ+ community in Hollywood.And fans are really connecting with this moment as well.One person tweeted saying quote, “I became super emotional watching Ellen DeGeneres--that people sought to dim her light is unacceptable. All I can say is, Equality is non-negotiable. And @RepHartzler --your discriminatory + hateful views on the LGBTQ+ community have no place in Congress.”And another said quote, “It was amazing, and so was Kate Mckinnon’s introduction. It was just what I needed today. The world needs more Ellen’s.”And we couldn’t agree more!The last emotional moment we will talk about for today, because I don’t want you all crying too much, is Jennifer Anniston talking about the Australian fires.Many celebs brought attention to the tragic fires that are currently happening in Australia.Jenn read Russell Crowe’s acceptance speech for him because he is back home in Australia helping his family affected by the fires.She got choked up when reading it and fans talked about this moment on Twitter.One fan tweeted saying quote, “No, YOU were getting emotional watching Jennifer Aniston fighting off tears reading Russell Crowe's acceptance speech on the Australia fires.”And another said quote, “Jennifer Aniston did a superb job hosting and reading out Russel Crowe’s message with sincerity and empathy”And we totally get it. The fires are tragic and we’d like to help however we can.In our description we’ve linked some ways to donate and get involved. Please consider donating if you are able to!And I want to hear from you all which moment made you cry the most.Was it Tom Hanks or Kate McKinnon or someone else?Let me know down in the comments below.After that, why don’t you dive in to more Clevver News by hitting that subscribe button and click that bell so you don’t miss any of our new stories.

In this video, I’m going to show you how to never do them incorrectly again and give you the fixes for the 10 most common pullup mistakes.  Whether you can do 10 pull-ups or more now or struggle to do one, you’ll find this incredibly helpful and I guarantee you will be doing more reps by the time the video is over.The first thing you need to be aware of is how you are gripping the bar. If you grip too narrow you will shift the focus of the movement from the stronger back muscles to the weaker muscles of the forearms. You want to make sure you are just outside of shoulder width with the hand placement for optimal performance on this exercise.That said, the brachioradialis and brachialis are muscles that are going to be contributing to the pullup and your ability to do the most reps possible so you are going to need to train them. You just don’t want them being the main drivers of the exercise. To supplement your back muscles in the exercise, be sure to include some cross body hammer curls as shown to increase the strength of the forearms and your overall strength on the pullup.Regarding the grip placement, it isn’t enough to just get the hand spacing down. You also want to be sure that you direct your pressure in the right way. Most people simply pull straight down on the bar or worse, they pull outwards because they’ve been told this will increase the activation of the lats. Both of these aren’t optimal. The best thing you can do is squeeze your hands inward towards each other and down at the same time. This will engage much more upper body muscle activation that will make your body feel as if it is floating up above the bar on every rep, instantly.Much of this has to do with plugging kinetic looseness (or energy leaks as I call them). You can take this even a step further by contracting other areas of your body that often get ignored during the exercise like your legs, ankles and core. Instead of dangling from the bar and letting your knees hang loosely, tighten you quads, point your feet down and really contract your core muscles and you will see an instant improvement in your ability to lift your body up over the bar.Now you don’t want to take these measures and then let it all loosen up when you get to the bottom of the rep. Most importantly, you do not want to get lax during the hanging portion of the pullup. This will place too much strain on the shoulders and is called unpacking. Instead, even though you want to get fully straightened at the elbows you want to keep your shoulder blades pulled down and back to create shoulder stability. This will allow for a lifetime of injury free pullups and more growth from the exercise.There are other biomechanical flaws that you will want to avoid with your pullups that I cover here but I also want to point out a couple of the programming issues that are often done incorrectly as well. For instance, you don’t want to always save your pullups for the end of your workout. Too often, because they are a bodyweight exercise, we save them for after we have already done our rows, deadlifts or pulldowns. You will never get the most out of the exercise when done in a fatigued state like this. Try moving them to the front of your workout and you will be surprised at how quickly you see gains just by making the switch.Finally, the exercise like any other, will respond to intensification techniques like drop sets and changes in the weight used during it. Use a band to accommodate your fatigue and get more total reps done in a workout - either as a drop set or as a simple lightening of the load as you would with any other traditional back exercise in your workout.If you’re looking for a program that will help you to do many more pullups while at the same time getting you in the best overall shape of your life, head to athleanx.com at the link below and follow the same step by step training that has created ripped athletic bodies for men and women of all ages and all levels of athleticism.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil – but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Open Sourced is a year-long reporting project from Recode by Vox that goes deep into the closed ecosystems of data, privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.
