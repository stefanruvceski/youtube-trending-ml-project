La bici encima del barro,con un vaso de pl√°stico en la gomapa que suene como un carro.Recarg√°bamos bater√≠a con malta indiay pan con ajo, nadie nos deten√≠a. √âramos inseparables, hasta que un d√≠alo mataron entre cuatro polic√≠as.Mi alegr√≠a sigue rota,se apagaron las luces en el parque de pelotaYa no queda casi nadie aqu√≠,A veces ya no quiero estar aqu√≠.Me siento solo aqu√≠, en el medio de la fiesta.Quiero estar en donde nadie me molesta,quemar mi libreta, soltar mi maleta.Quiero llamar al 7550822a ver qui√©n contestaLas peleas con mi padrastrocuando perd√≠a el control,las resolv√≠a con elviendo un partido de beisbol.Me invit√≥ a pelear un par de veces,Me escap√© de casa un par de veces.Pero nunca falt√≥ el alimento,nos defendi√≥ con m√∫sicatocando en casamientos.A veces al horno, a veces de lata y microondas.Compart√≠amos todo, la mesa era redonda.Clase media baja,nunca fuimos due√±os.El pr√©stamo del banco,se robaba nuestro sue√±o.La cuenta de ahorro vac√≠a,pero mami bailando flamenconos alegraba el d√≠a.Dej√≥ de actuar pa cuidarnos a los cuatroy nos convertimos en su obra de teatro.Ella se puso nuestras botas,y su vida fue de nuestros logrosy nuestras derrotas.Mi padrastro se fue con otros peces,nos mudamos de la calle 13.Me fui a buscar la suerte en un mar de paja,y mi vida entera la empaqu√© en una caja.En la universidad de arte me becaron,a la mitad de mis amigos los mataron.Empec√© a rapear denuevo, empec√© a creer denuevo.

I'm just proud of myself is all. This video is about how I am dumb. It's an edited down list of things that really put into perspective of how square brained I am. There was more stuff I didn't include or cut out because it's not much of a story / I realized my realizations were not right. Here's a bonus though: I thought fool proof was full proof for the longest time.I tried putting bg music in this video. I think the end product came out pretty well. Hopefully you like it too. Probably will do more in future videos.There's a stream coming after I post this video in a couple hours.

This summer, Oscar¬Æ winner Jordan Peele unleashes a fresh take on the blood-chilling urban legend that your friend‚Äôs older sibling probably told you about at a sleepover: Candyman. Rising filmmaker Nia DaCosta (Little Woods) directs this contemporary incarnation of the cult classic.  For as long as residents can remember, the housing projects of Chicago‚Äôs Cabrini Green neighborhood were terrorized by a word-of-mouth ghost story about a supernatural killer with a hook for a hand, easily summoned by those daring to repeat his name five times into a mirror. In present day, a decade after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, visual artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; HBO‚Äôs Watchmen, Us) and his girlfriend, gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris; If Beale Street Could Talk, The Photograph), move into a luxury loft condo in Cabrini, now gentrified beyond recognition and inhabited by upwardly mobile millennials.With Anthony‚Äôs painting career on the brink of stalling, a chance encounter with a Cabrini Green old-timer (Colman Domingo; HBO‚Äôs Euphoria, Assassination Nation) exposes Anthony to the tragically horrific nature of the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifyingly viral wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny.Universal Pictures presents, from Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures and Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld‚Äôs Monkeypaw Productions, in association with BRON Creative, Candyman. Candyman is directed by DaCosta, and is produced by Ian Cooper (Us), Rosenfeld and Peele. The screenplay is by Peele & Rosenfeld and DaCosta. The film is based on the 1992 film Candyman, written by Bernard Rose, and the short story ‚ÄúThe Forbidden‚Äù by Clive Barker. The film‚Äôs executive producers are David Kern, Aaron L. Gilbert and Jason Cloth."

Thank you for caring about me. It means more to me than you could possibly know. ---In January 2020, a documentary was released called ‚ÄúThe Witnesses.‚Äù TRIGGER WARNING: basically all the worst things people can do‚ÄúThe Witnesses‚Äù can be found on Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/A-Window-For-Justice/dp/B084TDX7L3and also on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/tv/show?id=S9vTv9nX1qTSiAwvdSGC-Q and other places on the internet if you dig deep enough. I encourage you to watch it and share it. I believe the survivors. I know survivors. I am a survivor. ---I can‚Äôt describe what it feels like to be a child rejected by their parent. It strips you of your humanity. It makes you a shell. Nothing more than an object someone can opt-in to cherish and love when convenient for them and their beliefs. It reduces you to a choice. I am not a choice. I am a person deserving of love and respect. Back in August, my Dad and step-mom pulled me aside to tell me that they would not be coming to my wedding. I had included them on a list of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù e-mails my wedding planner asked for, but had assumed we would all silently agree not to discuss it. That surely I had suffered enough. That I had struggled enough. That I had lost enough family already. But they needed to remind me that my love was unnatural, immoral, and a crime within their organization.  To remind me that Ella wasn‚Äôt worthy of being in a family photo. And lastly, to remind me that if I ever used my public platform to speak out against their organization that that ‚Äúwould be it.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs taken me six months to decide I am comfortable with that. My Dad is an Elder. I was a raised a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. I was never baptized. However, I grew up in the organization, I can recite all the names of the literature from memory, I‚Äôve been to more District Conventions and Memorial Services than I care to recall. I‚Äôve gone out in Field Service. I‚Äôve preached Door to Door. I still have the songs singing in my head. I grew up fearing my annihilation and the annihilation of everyone who is not a Witness. Returning to the choices we make‚Ä¶ I choose to share this:I do not believe it is a safe or healthy environment for women or children. I believe it protects those it should not protect. I believe it holds itself above the law. I believe it is a cult. If you would like to learn more about The Witnesses - I encourage you to speak to people who have fled the cult and lost everything in the process. Again, I was never officially baptized, and yet this organization has taken from me something I desperately wanted to carry through this life and into the next - the unconditional love and support of a parent."

In this video, I‚Äôm going to show you the biomechanical and scientific reason why this is the case for you and, more importantly, give you an exercise for your chest that will make it grow better than everything else you‚Äôve tried.The key to a bigger chest is making sure that you are activating the pecs and not your shoulders and triceps during your pressing. Some of the limitations of the bench press are known to be inhibiting the very activation that you are seeking. These are worsened by the fact that some people just aren‚Äôt genetically as predisposed to flourish with the bench press.Let‚Äôs start by discussing the biomechanical limitations of this popular chest exercise. First, the range of motion. We know that horizontal adduction of the arm across the chest (at the shoulder joint) is one of the primary functions of the pec major / chest muscles. During the bench press, your arm only goes through about a total of 80 to 90 degrees of adduction. This comes from a negative fifteen degrees at the bottom of the bench press up to about 70 degrees or so at the top of the rep.When people have a hard time building their chest they simply don‚Äôt get enough activation of the pecs to stimulate growth. This is worsened by the fact that they often substitute pec contraction for deltoid and triceps activation to move the bar. The second thing to note is that the strength curve of the bench press is descending, meaning that as the bar moves away from the chest the exercise gets easier and tension is lost on the pecs. So when the shoulder is in its most adducted position, the corresponding tension on the pecs is at its lowest. This again does not bode well for the exercise in its capacity to add lots of mass to the chest.Biologically speaking, certain individuals have lower proportions of fast twitch fibers in their chest, which only further decreases the responsiveness of the exercise to a heavily loaded exercise like the bench press. Don‚Äôt misunderstand, the bench is a formidable exercise for your chest in terms of its ability to be progressively overloaded and to create chest growth by simply applying more tension to the chest than other pec exercises. It just isn‚Äôt enough.The length of ones arms can also be a negative when it comes to seeing chest gains during the bench press. Those with longer arms will have a harder time creating the leverage needed to lift heavy weights on the exercise and therefore tend to struggle more with letting the chest lean on the delts and triceps too much for assistance during the lift.The answer to your problems is to incorporate the cable chest press with adduction as well. This powerful chest mass booster is one of the most underrated and effective exercises for building a bigger chest. The key to the success of this chest movement is the fact that it addresses all the primary weaknesses of the barbell bench press. Not only can you get much more adduction from the movement but the tension on the chest at the peak of adduction is far greater, leading to more overall stimulation during the exercise.Additionally, the strength curve compliments that of the barbell bench press and allows for a much better stimulation of the chest over a greater portion of the range of motion. Using this along with the bench press performed heavy, is one of the best one-two combos you can use when you are trying to build a big chest.Be sure to follow the tips for setting up this exercise correctly and how to perform it with proper form so as not to leave any of the potential gains on the table. I include setup instructions in the video as well.If you are looking to build a bigger chest fast and feel glad you found this video but wish you had a complete workout program that would get you results without thinking, be sure to check out my programs at athleanx.com via the link below and start training with science.

I'm back with another episode of squishy makeovers. This is a good one! I made some creations, I'm really proud of, I hope you guys like them just as much as I do.GEORGIE MERCH: https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/listing/georgie-5839?product=2Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.
