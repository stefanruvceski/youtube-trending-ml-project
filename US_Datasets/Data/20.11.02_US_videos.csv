Now. Because this was a surprise performance and‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not 2003, many people were caught off guard.In fact, at the award show, the camera panned over to a few celebrities that shared exactly how they were feeling about this surprise, through their faces alone. Starting off, with Indina Menzel. Who, honestly, just looked perplexed.Then of course there was Martin Scorsese who appeared to be so relaxed by the performance that he started to fall asleep.And lastly, there was Billie Eillish and her brother Fineas, who both, similar to Indina, looked absolutely baffled.Follow:http://www.twitter.com/reneearielhttp://www.instagram.com/reneearielhttp://www.twitter.com/fionazaringhttp://www.instagram.com/fionazaringSharing is Caring..."

You can also do slices but‚Ä¶ chunks are better #teamchunk.2) Heat butter over high in a large sautee pan until melted and toasty. Add apples, sugar, and salt to the pan and sautee for 15 minutes until the apples have broken down and a caramel starts to form on the bottom of the pan.3) Cover in Cheeto dust and continue to sautee for an additional 5 minutes.Equipment: * Veggie peeler* Small Cheffy knife* Cutting board * Saute pan with high edges * Wooden spoon Step 3: Streusel and BakeIngredients* 1 bag Crunchy Cheetos* ¬º cup flour* ¬Ω cup granulated sugar* 4 Tbsp cold butter cut into cubes* 1 baked cheetos pie dough* 1 portion apple pie filling* 1 bottle Reddi Whip* ¬Ω cup Cheetos Puffs dust1) Dump a handful of Cheetos into a Ziploc bag and use a blunt object to smash it into coarse crumbs.2) Gently toss 1 cup of cheeto crumbs with flour, sugar, and butter cubes.3) Pour your apple pie filling into the pie crust then add the streusel topping on top.

Little did I know Xavier would beat all the odds and that we would get to know each other and become brothers. Over three months of getting to know him, he taught me about what it means to fight for your life, to love unconditionally and to appreciate every single breath. He always wanted to start a YouTube channel and I told him that no matter what, his story would be told. He took comfort in that. Here is that story. I know he's here with us. I know he's watching this video and smiling at these beautiful moments we got to spend with each other. I miss him and I know I'll see him again one day. Thank you for watching. It means a lot to me and I know it means a lot to him.Love,MattIf you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/15653...PERFECT ROYALTY FREE MUSIC FOR YOUTUBE: free 30 day trial here: http://share.epidemicsound.com/wFFbr Musicbed has amazing montage and cinematic music:http://share.mscbd.fm/YesTheoryFor an amazing b-roll and footage library, checkout: http://storyblocks.com/YesTheoryYes Theory Spotify Playlist: https://open.spotify.com/user/t-boogy...Exclusive challenges on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/Who are we?

I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny.

This is What Happened to Her Brain. ‚ñ∫  https://youtu.be/J3HivpHP-5IA Woman Drank 1 Liter Soy Sauce In 2 Hours. This Is What Happened To Her Brain. ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/QiBpKuTrFrwThis is a case of beer potomania, which is a very specific case of hypotonic hyponatremia. Humans need solute in order to produce urine. These solutes are predominantly sodium, potassium and urea, along with others. Beer contains little to no sodium or potassium. Drinking only 50 beers daily for weeks causes solute loss, on top of vitamin deficiency and poor nutrition.Slowly as sodium is depleted, more volume from beer is accumulated in the body.Beer contains water, alcohol and carbohydrates, the latter which induces an insulin response in the body to prevent muscle catabolism.Muscle catabolism could count as protein that would produce urea, but because of insulin response, it doesn't happen, further exacerbating solute loss.The accumulation of water in the body and depletion of solute leads to chronic hyponatremia. This is because the kidneys need solute exchange in the process of urine production. If these solutes are absent, minimal urine is produced, and the urine that is produced is maximally dilute (eg low specific gravity) Neurologic sequelae from low sodium presence in blood include seizures and is an emergency.In this patient, it wasn't clear whether he was suffering withdrawal syndrome, chronic hyponatremia, or both. In the case as it happened, the hospital ran out of medicines for the SE because it was so frequent, and needed to borrow twice from neighboring hospitals.Osmotic demyelination syndrome appears to have a higher risk in patients who have more electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic derangements. Please see references for more information.These cases are patients who I, or my colleagues have seen. They are de-identified and many instances have been presented in more depth in an academic setting. These videos are not individual medical advice and are for general educational purposes only.

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Three boasts a brand new group of celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The White Tiger, The Kangaroo and Miss Monster.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

By comparison, he added, just $18 million was spent on preparedness in Congo‚Äôs neighbor Uganda before the virus crossed the border.‚ÄúThis must be a lesson for the rest of the world,‚Äù he said.The plea from WHO‚Äôs top official comes as the deadly coronavirus has now killed at least 362 people and sickened more than 17,400 worldwide, including patients in the U.S. and Europe.The respiratory illness, which is capable of spreading through human-to-human contact, is not yet considered a pandemic. A pandemic is ‚Äúan epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people,‚Äù according to WHO. While the new virus has spread to almost two dozen countries, the majority of the cases remain in mainland China.Nevertheless, many global health experts expect the virus will become a pandemic. Since emerging about a month ago in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus has infected more people than the 2003 SARS epidemic, which sickened roughly 8,100 people across the globe over nine months. As of Monday, there are nearly 200 cases in at least 23 countries, outside of China, a handful of which have been transmitted from human contact within those countries.On Thursday, WHO declared the virus a global health emergency after declining to do so at two previous meetings.Tedros said the ‚Äúcontinued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China‚Äù were ‚Äúmost deeply disturbing.‚ÄùFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC¬ª Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
