Fans and celebrities alike paid tribute to the icon, including the Texas native's longtime friend and collaborator, Dolly Parton. Parton wrote on Instagram,You never know how much you love somebody until they're gone. I've had so many wonderful years and wonderful times with my friend Kenny, but above all the music and the success I loved him as a wonderful man and a true friend. Fellow country star Reba McEntire commented on her post, quote, Dolly, he sure loved you.Not only did Rogers and Parton share a lot of love, they also worked together on various projects. From the duo's 1985 concert film, Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton: Together, to their hits like Islands in the Stream, they were an unstoppable force. In fact, the two were so in sync that relationship rumors dogged them for years.Some might assume this topic was uncomfortable for Rogers' five ex-wives, some of whom spoke out after the country crooner's passing. This includes Marianne Gordon, Rogers' fourth wife and mother to his son, Christopher Cody Rogers.Marianne Gordon, an actor, was married to Kenny Rogers from 1977 to 1993. During this time, Gordon got to know the country legend on a deep level, especially where it concerned his close friendship with Dolly Parton. When asked by Closer Weekly about the romance rumors on March 24, shortly after Rogers' death, she replied, I never felt uncomfortable at all. I just knew him so well. But, it's funny that you say that. We had a tennis pro who traveled with us, Doug Dean asked me too. I told him Kenny said I like her as a friend and we have a great thing on stage. We'd lose it. There is sexual tension and teasing each other and it would screw it up.Although Gordon is pretty sure nothing happened between the collaborators, she doesn't rule it out. She added,Dolly might have [made a move though]. It's entered my mind because she always said she thought like a man. I don't mean it badly. Dolly is a fun girl.For those who might not believe Marianne Gordon's account of Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers' relationship, they should probably take note of a 2013 interview the two did with ABC News. When asked directly whether they were an item at one point, the Jolene singer replied, It never crossed our minds because he was with people. I've been married, forty, I've been with my husband 48 years.Rogers joked, I think that chemistry and that connection comes from an unrequited love, if you will, because we never consummated anything.At the end of the day, the pair's story begins and ends with friendship. Parton told CMT's Cody Alan in 2017,Kenny's friendship means more to me than our hit records. Actually, we're kind of like soul mates. He's from Texas and I'm from Tennessee. There's an old famous country song, 'T for Texas, T for Tennessee.' We always sing that to each other. She added, I love his singing. I love his voice. I never tire of hearing him sing. And I think our voices blend great, so I'm really proud of the musical part of that as well.Of course, it's completely reasonable to have a platonic soulmate. And we think this perfectly explains why Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers never dated.Watch the video to see What Kenny Rogers' Ex-Wife Has To Say About Dolly Parton.#DollyParton #KennyRogers #RIPKennyRogersRead Full Article: https://www.nickiswift.com/198211/what-kenny-rogers-ex-wife-has-to-say-about-dolly-parton/"

The virus is currently spreading through every state, and no one is safe including celebrities and politicians. In fact, the list of celebs with coronavirus keeps on growing.On March 16th, 2020, actor Idris Elba announced that he'd tested positive for the coronavirus, tweeting: I feel ok, I have no symptoms so far but have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus. Stay home people and be pragmatic. I will keep you updated on how I'm doing. No panic.In the accompanying video message, Elba explained that he self-quarantined and got tested immediately after learning that a person he'd come into contact with had tested positive three days prior. Elba then explained why he decided to share his diagnosis with the world:He goes on to say, If you're feeling ill, or you feel like you should be tested, or if you've been exposed, then do something about it.Elba ended the video by saying,Look, we live in a divided world right now. We can all feel it. [...] But now is the time for solidarity. Now's the time for thinking about each other. [...] Stay positive.

However recently, I was asked to detail a couple very rare cars, Ferrari, Corvette, Camaro, and a Lamborghini to name a few...for an upcoming auction. The first was a Bizzarrini P538 which is valued at nearly $1,000,000 and is by the far the most expensive barn find I have had the privilege of detailing. This is the first wash and paint polishing this vehicle has received in over 32 years. It was parked next to a Noble with a Ferrari engine which was also in need of an extreme detailing. I wanted to call this a disgusting car make over or a disaster detailing junk yard find, but the Bizzarrini is just too awesome to give it such a title. Hope you enjoy!

Enjoy the video! #TheArtOfColor Join Me On Social:Instagram: @AlexandrasGirlyTalk http://bit.ly/1TSclUmFacebook: Alexandra Beth https://goo.gl/dtTo71Hi, I'm Alexandra.  I believe life can be both glorious, tricky and painful.. which we all know.  Beauty is a practice I have enjoyed from early childhood as a way to build my confidence in myself.  Not just on special occasions, but in my every day life and decision making. On my YouTube channel I show you practical steps and psychology to understand and apply methods in all areas of beauty; inclding fashion, makeup, hairstyling and femininity, to help us evolve and transform into our personal visions. I believe when a girl feels good about herself, she can make better choices for herself in ALL areas of life.  Welcome to my channel, I'm glad you found me!Business Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.comFTC: this video is sponsored by Audible"

The Rockstar Energy Drink / Nexen Tire Toyota Corolla Hatchback is the latest competition build from the Hawthorne, California, based team. Team owner Stephan Papadakis is a legend of sport¬≠ compact racing who began building his reputation in the 1990s with the first front-wheel ¬≠drive, tube¬≠-chassis drag car in the U.S. The team earned multiple records and championships in the discipline, turning in elapsed times and trap speeds previously thought unattainable in front¬≠-drive drag cars. Papadakis' successes in front¬≠-wheel drive were matched by his efforts in rear¬≠-wheel drive when he campaigned a Honda Civic that became just the fifth car to join the NHRA's Sport Compact 200 MPH club"

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video."

As it has for so, so many of us, this global pandemic has absolutely flipped our world upside down. What went from a virus that seemed far away in China, quickly made it‚Äôs way across the globe forcing us to quarantine in our 60 sq-ft in Morocco. And while quarantining was going well for us it became apparent that things would be different for a long while.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. The gravity of what we‚Äôve just done hasn‚Äôt quite sunk in and we ((especially me (Bec)) are having a really hard time adjusting to our new reality.  Having said that we think the most important thing we can all do now is STAY HOME, keep healthy with healing foods & try to look at this as a time that we (and the planet) desperately needed to reset and realign.

In fact, we are still processing everything that has happened over the last week and continues to happen... No one knows where we will end up, where our beloved tiny home on wheels will make it or for how long this pandemic will take over life as we know but all we can do is try to remain positive and move forward in the direction that feels right for us.

Experts say aggressive diagnostic testing is essential in order to learn where and how an epidemic spreads. But in the critical first weeks of the outbreak in the U.S., one problem after another prevented doctors, clinics, and labs around the country from testing enough people. Patients in America were being sent home as hospitals rationed their test supply, while other countries like South Korea found a way to test hundreds of thousands of people quickly. Now, the U.S. is months behind in understanding the true scope of the virus.
