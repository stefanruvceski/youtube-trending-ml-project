Born and raised in L.A., the 24-year-old self-taught singer-rapper behind “Candy” is a vet of sorts. The arts were central to her upbringing, and she started sharing her music on Soundcloud back in 2013. A year later she dropped her much-buzzed-about ‘Purrr!’ EP, and since she’s nurtured an ever-growing array of feverish fans who revere her for combining a radiant charisma with a unique flow and tongue-in-cheek lyrics (see: the irresistible“MOOO!”). Seems like Doja has designed her version of alt-R&B to take off in any direction she chooses. Tours with Lizzo and Theophilius London led right into 2018’s impressive ‘Amala’ debut, followed by last year’s ‘Hot Pink.’ That album’s “Say So” is currently clocking big numbers. Arresting visuals help. Her videos for “Rules,” and “Say So” are wildly fun. Ditto for the hyper footage from ‘Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey’ that makes a nice parallel to Doja’s “Boss Bitch” track. When the Vevo production team united with the feline phenom to figure out performance ideas, the creative juices were flowing. The goal? Put the “cat” in Doja Cat - a decision that resulted in what’s probably our most ambitious studio build to date for a LIFT performance. For “Streets,” we built a massive bowl of milk. Doja hopped in that 2% and bodied the beat - clearly in her element. Time to wet your whiskers, and if this one’s not wild enough for ya, stay tuned: another performance and short film are on their way.

But more than 20 states are considering legislation similar to Nebraska's, and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both supported national right to repair legislation for farmers.When it comes to repair, farmers have always been self reliant. But the modernization of tractors and other farm equipment over the past few decades has left most farmers in the dust thanks to diagnostic software that large manufacturers hold a monopoly over.  In this episode of State of Repair, we go to Nebraska to talk to the farmers and mechanics who are fighting large manufacturers like John Deere for the right to access the diagnostic software they need to repair their tractors.This video was originally aired on Motherboard in 2018.Click here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICEAbout VICE:The Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

Here I show you that one of the biggest muscles in the forearm, responsible for a major portion of the size, is not even technically a forearm muscle. The brachioradialis is a powerful elbow flexor that also has abilities to pronate the forearm. Many will focus all of their forearm workouts and exercises on wrist curls and wrist extensions. This is a mistake when trying to build up mass in the forearm muscles.To start, it helps to revisit the anatomy of the lower arm. The brachioradialis starts on the upper arm bone, the humerus, and inserts on the distal end of the radius (the bone on the thumb side of the forearm). This muscle does not cross the wrist joint and therefore has no action on the wrist. This means that the brachioradialis does not extend or flex the wrist like the other forearm muscles does.In order to work it the most you need to spend your time focusing on the actions of the elbow, specifically flexing the elbow. The position with which you do this matters however. If you do it with the forearm supinated you will instantly place most of the load on the biceps rather than the brachioradialis. To get the brachioradialis you will want to have your forearm either in neutral or pronated. Here is where some controversy comes in.Many will point to the fact that the brachioradialis is strongest in the neutral position of the forearm. This is true. That does not mean however that the muscle is most fully shortened or activated in this position. It can achieve a greater level of contraction when it is both flexed at the elbow and pronated at the forearm. Does this mean that you should not train it out of the neutral position? No. It means that you can choose exercises that allow it to be trained heavier for progressive overload in this position but that you still need to include forearm exercises that allow it to be trained from a pronated position. The most classic forearm exercise when it comes to this is the reverse barbell curl. Here, you can do it with either a straight bar to achieve the fully pronated position or with an EZ bar to get a more neutral position. Remember to adjust your weights accordingly to stimulate the muscle as discussed above. Also, the amount of brachioradialis activation is higher with elbow flexion above 90 degrees so remember not to cut the range of motion short on any rep.You can also do this with dumbbells. As shown, you can hold the dumbbell with an offset grip which will help you to overload pronation at the same time that you can flex the elbow to train the brachioradialis optimally. The version shown here is good at accomplishing both and can be done with most dumbbells at the gym.The lat pulldown variation is another great option for achieving a reverse curl and training the brachioradialis to get bigger forearms. The key is to keep the bar moving behind the head and not just to the head to take advantage of the greater activation with greater elbow flexion.When it comes down to it however, if you want to get jacked forearms one of the easiest things you can do is remember to pick up the weights when you’re done with them. Yes, the position of carrying plates and racking them is one of the best ways to activate this muscle and get it to grow with the additional volume you achieve by doing this repeatedly during the workout week. Not just that, you’ll be more liked at the gym for not being that guy who never picks up his weights.If you’re looking to get bigger forearms and want to build your entire body at the same time, be sure to head to athleanx.com at the link below.

La bici encima del barro,con un vaso de plástico en la gomapa que suene como un carro.Recargábamos batería con malta indiay pan con ajo, nadie nos detenía. Éramos inseparables, hasta que un díalo mataron entre cuatro policías.Mi alegría sigue rota,se apagaron las luces en el parque de pelotaYa no queda casi nadie aquí,A veces ya no quiero estar aquí.Me siento solo aquí, en el medio de la fiesta.Quiero estar en donde nadie me molesta,quemar mi libreta, soltar mi maleta.Quiero llamar al 7550822a ver quién contestaLas peleas con mi padrastrocuando perdía el control,las resolvía con elviendo un partido de beisbol.Me invitó a pelear un par de veces,Me escapé de casa un par de veces.Pero nunca faltó el alimento,nos defendió con músicatocando en casamientos.A veces al horno, a veces de lata y microondas.Compartíamos todo, la mesa era redonda.Clase media baja,nunca fuimos dueños.El préstamo del banco,se robaba nuestro sueño.La cuenta de ahorro vacía,pero mami bailando flamenconos alegraba el día.Dejó de actuar pa cuidarnos a los cuatroy nos convertimos en su obra de teatro.Ella se puso nuestras botas,y su vida fue de nuestros logrosy nuestras derrotas.Mi padrastro se fue con otros peces,nos mudamos de la calle 13.Me fui a buscar la suerte en un mar de paja,y mi vida entera la empaqué en una caja.En la universidad de arte me becaron,a la mitad de mis amigos los mataron.Empecé a rapear denuevo, empecé a creer denuevo. Volví, saqué un disco.Redes: Official Site: http://residente.comFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/residenteTwitter: http://twitter.com/ResidenteInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/residenteSuscríbete! https://smarturl.it/subscriberesidente#Residente #RenéOfficial Music Video by Residente performing “René” © 2020 Sony Music Entertainment US Latin LLC"

I'm just proud of myself is all. This video is about how I am dumb. It's an edited down list of things that really put into perspective of how square brained I am. There was more stuff I didn't include or cut out because it's not much of a story / I realized my realizations were not right. Here's a bonus though: I thought fool proof was full proof for the longest time.I tried putting bg music in this video. I think the end product came out pretty well. Hopefully you like it too. Probably will do more in future videos.There's a stream coming after I post this video in a couple hours.

Thank you for caring about me. It means more to me than you could possibly know. ---In January 2020, a documentary was released called “The Witnesses.” TRIGGER WARNING: basically all the worst things people can do“The Witnesses” can be found on Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/A-Window-For-Justice/dp/B084TDX7L3or Oxygen: https://www.oxygen.com/the-witnesses/season-1/the-watchtowerand also on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/tv/show?id=S9vTv9nX1qTSiAwvdSGC-Q and other places on the internet if you dig deep enough. I encourage you to watch it and share it. I believe the survivors. I know survivors. I am a survivor. (UPDATE 2/29:If you need resources or are looking for answers about the JWs:https://www.jwfacts.com/ & https://jw.support/)---I can’t describe what it feels like to be a child rejected by their parent. It strips you of your humanity. It makes you a shell. Nothing more than an object someone can opt-in to cherish and love when convenient for them and their beliefs. It reduces you to a choice. I am not a choice. I am a person deserving of love and respect. Back in August, my Dad and step-mom pulled me aside to tell me that they would not be coming to my wedding. I had included them on a list of “family” e-mails my wedding planner asked for, but had assumed we would all silently agree not to discuss it. That surely I had suffered enough. That I had struggled enough. That I had lost enough family already. But they needed to remind me that my love was unnatural, immoral, and a crime within their organization.  To remind me that Ella wasn’t worthy of being in a family photo. And lastly, to remind me that if I ever used my public platform to speak out against their organization that that “would be it.”It’s taken me six months to decide I am comfortable with that. My Dad is an Elder. I was a raised a Jehovah’s Witness. I was never baptized. However, I grew up in the organization, I can recite all the names of the literature from memory, I’ve been to more District Conventions and Memorial Services than I care to recall. I’ve gone out in Field Service. I’ve preached Door to Door. I still have the songs singing in my head. I grew up fearing my annihilation and the annihilation of everyone who is not a Witness. Returning to the choices we make… I choose to share this:I do not believe it is a safe or healthy environment for women or children. I believe it protects those it should not protect. I believe it holds itself above the law. I believe it is a cult. If you would like to learn more about The Witnesses - I encourage you to speak to people who have fled the cult and lost everything in the process. Again, I was never officially baptized, and yet this organization has taken from me something I desperately wanted to carry through this life and into the next - the unconditional love and support of a parent."

This summer, Oscar® winner Jordan Peele unleashes a fresh take on the blood-chilling urban legend that your friend’s older sibling probably told you about at a sleepover: Candyman. Rising filmmaker Nia DaCosta (Little Woods) directs this contemporary incarnation of the cult classic.  For as long as residents can remember, the housing projects of Chicago’s Cabrini Green neighborhood were terrorized by a word-of-mouth ghost story about a supernatural killer with a hook for a hand, easily summoned by those daring to repeat his name five times into a mirror. In present day, a decade after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, visual artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; HBO’s Watchmen, Us) and his girlfriend, gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris; If Beale Street Could Talk, The Photograph), move into a luxury loft condo in Cabrini, now gentrified beyond recognition and inhabited by upwardly mobile millennials.With Anthony’s painting career on the brink of stalling, a chance encounter with a Cabrini Green old-timer (Colman Domingo; HBO’s Euphoria, Assassination Nation) exposes Anthony to the tragically horrific nature of the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifyingly viral wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny.Universal Pictures presents, from Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures and Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld’s Monkeypaw Productions, in association with BRON Creative, Candyman. Candyman is directed by DaCosta, and is produced by Ian Cooper (Us), Rosenfeld and Peele. The screenplay is by Peele & Rosenfeld and DaCosta. The film is based on the 1992 film Candyman, written by Bernard Rose, and the short story “The Forbidden” by Clive Barker. The film’s executive producers are David Kern, Aaron L. Gilbert and Jason Cloth."
