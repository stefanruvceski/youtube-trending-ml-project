Subscribe to our channel and don't forget to turn on notifications: http://goo.gl/0bsAjOAs of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.Both SARS and COVID-19 are in the coronavirus family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge.

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUMSpecial thanks to:Prof. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.comHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.Schrodinger's cat animation by Iván TelloWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny HymanFilming of opening sequence by Casey RentzSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the scriptMusic from https://epidemicsound.com Experimental 1 Serene Story 2 Seaweed Colorful Animation 4"

Born and raised in L.A., the 24-year-old self-taught singer-rapper behind “Candy” is a vet of sorts. The arts were central to her upbringing, and she started sharing her music on Soundcloud back in 2013. A year later she dropped her much-buzzed-about ‘Purrr!’ EP, and since she’s nurtured an ever-growing array of feverish fans who revere her for combining a radiant charisma with a unique flow and tongue-in-cheek lyrics (see: the irresistible“MOOO!”). Seems like Doja has designed her version of alt-R&B to take off in any direction she chooses. Tours with Lizzo and Theophilius London led right into 2018’s impressive ‘Amala’ debut, followed by last year’s ‘Hot Pink.’ That album’s “Say So” is currently clocking big numbers. Arresting visuals help. Her videos for “Rules,” and “Say So” are wildly fun. Ditto for the hyper footage from ‘Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey’ that makes a nice parallel to Doja’s “Boss Bitch” track. When the Vevo production team united with the feline phenom to figure out performance ideas, the creative juices were flowing. The goal? Put the “cat” in Doja Cat - a decision that resulted in what’s probably our most ambitious studio build to date for a LIFT performance. For “Streets,” we built a massive bowl of milk. Doja hopped in that 2% and bodied the beat - clearly in her element. Time to wet your whiskers, and if this one’s not wild enough for ya, stay tuned: another performance and short film are on their way.

He sees his music as therapeutic, not just for him, but for anyone who comes in contact with it.As genuine a modern day outlaw as you can get, Jelly's music incorporates influences ranging from Southern Rock to Dirty South rap. With his forthcoming album, A Beautiful Disaster, Jelly Roll draws you in with his ability to tell a story that you didn't even know you were a part of. With songs like Creature, I Need You, Nothing Left At All and the dark, haunting love story Suicide along with features from the likes of Tech N9ne, Struggle Jennings, Krizz Kaliko and Lil Wyte, A Beautiful Disaster gives you a direct link to the life of Jelly Roll - the trials and tribulations, along with the celebrations and victories."

But he told lawmakers Thursday they cannot stop the virus.   We've never suggested we were capable of doing that, Ken Cuccinelli told the Senate Homeland Security Committee during a hearing on administration efforts to fight the spread of the virus. Cuccinelli said Customs and Border Patrol and Homeland Security are putting increased resources on the ports of entries on the northern and southern U.S. borders to stop any potential travelers with the virus from entering the country. He said officials have already barred some 300 people trying to cross into the United States due to virus concerns. Those people were primarily Canadians who had traveled to China, with the second largest group being Chinese nationals. We have been very aware of it and confronting it head on and turning those folks back, frankly, Cuccinelli said.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6634129/coronavirus-pushes-west/Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#Coronavirus #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #GlobalNews"

But more than 20 states are considering legislation similar to Nebraska's, and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both supported national right to repair legislation for farmers.When it comes to repair, farmers have always been self reliant. But the modernization of tractors and other farm equipment over the past few decades has left most farmers in the dust thanks to diagnostic software that large manufacturers hold a monopoly over.  In this episode of State of Repair, we go to Nebraska to talk to the farmers and mechanics who are fighting large manufacturers like John Deere for the right to access the diagnostic software they need to repair their tractors.This video was originally aired on Motherboard in 2018.Click here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICEAbout VICE:The Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

The brachioradialis is a powerful elbow flexor that also has abilities to pronate the forearm. Many will focus all of their forearm workouts and exercises on wrist curls and wrist extensions. This is a mistake when trying to build up mass in the forearm muscles.To start, it helps to revisit the anatomy of the lower arm. The brachioradialis starts on the upper arm bone, the humerus, and inserts on the distal end of the radius (the bone on the thumb side of the forearm). This muscle does not cross the wrist joint and therefore has no action on the wrist. This means that the brachioradialis does not extend or flex the wrist like the other forearm muscles does.In order to work it the most you need to spend your time focusing on the actions of the elbow, specifically flexing the elbow. The position with which you do this matters however. If you do it with the forearm supinated you will instantly place most of the load on the biceps rather than the brachioradialis. To get the brachioradialis you will want to have your forearm either in neutral or pronated. Here is where some controversy comes in.Many will point to the fact that the brachioradialis is strongest in the neutral position of the forearm. This is true. That does not mean however that the muscle is most fully shortened or activated in this position. It can achieve a greater level of contraction when it is both flexed at the elbow and pronated at the forearm. Does this mean that you should not train it out of the neutral position? No. It means that you can choose exercises that allow it to be trained heavier for progressive overload in this position but that you still need to include forearm exercises that allow it to be trained from a pronated position. The most classic forearm exercise when it comes to this is the reverse barbell curl. Here, you can do it with either a straight bar to achieve the fully pronated position or with an EZ bar to get a more neutral position. Remember to adjust your weights accordingly to stimulate the muscle as discussed above. Also, the amount of brachioradialis activation is higher with elbow flexion above 90 degrees so remember not to cut the range of motion short on any rep.You can also do this with dumbbells. As shown, you can hold the dumbbell with an offset grip which will help you to overload pronation at the same time that you can flex the elbow to train the brachioradialis optimally. The version shown here is good at accomplishing both and can be done with most dumbbells at the gym.The lat pulldown variation is another great option for achieving a reverse curl and training the brachioradialis to get bigger forearms. The key is to keep the bar moving behind the head and not just to the head to take advantage of the greater activation with greater elbow flexion.When it comes down to it however, if you want to get jacked forearms one of the easiest things you can do is remember to pick up the weights when you’re done with them. Yes, the position of carrying plates and racking them is one of the best ways to activate this muscle and get it to grow with the additional volume you achieve by doing this repeatedly during the workout week. Not just that, you’ll be more liked at the gym for not being that guy who never picks up his weights.If you’re looking to get bigger forearms and want to build your entire body at the same time, be sure to head to athleanx.com at the link below.
