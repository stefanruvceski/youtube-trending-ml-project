In this video, I’m going to give you a complete home workout routine with all sets and reps included to help you to build muscle regardless of whether or not you ever step foot in a gym. The key to the effectiveness of this perfect home workout is that it pairs exercises together in a way that allows you to train to greater overload than would be possible if you stuck with one single exercise, and it will keep the workouts brief at the same time.This perfect home workout consists of not one but two complete total body workouts. The first, workout A, is to be performed on Monday and Friday of week 1. Workout B is to be performed on Wednesday. In week 2, this is flipped so that A is performed once on Wednesday and B is performed on both Monday and Friday. You can continue to alternate the workouts in this way if you decide to do this for longer.This workout for home is going to allow you to hit your total body in under one hour.With this being the goal, the idea is not to try and hit each muscle with too many individual exercises since this could lead to an excessively long workout and potential for doing too much in the given workout. Instead, we select the exercises based on movement patterns that we know we want to hit to accomplish our goal of building muscle everywhere.These patterns are broken down below and the exercises included in each are shown.Keep in mind, there are two complete versions of each workout to be sure that the beginners and more advanced trainees can follow this program and get results from it.Here is how to construct the perfect home total body workout A:1. SQUAT / ANTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Alt. Single Leg Box Squats (use low box if advanced / higher box for beginners)1 1/2 Bottomed Out Squats (to failure)Jump Squats2. UPPER PUSH (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Handstand Pushups OR Power PushawaysRotational Pushups OR Knee Rotational PushupsCobra Pushups (long head contracted) OR Knee Cobra Pushups3. HINGE / POSTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Alt. Single Leg Heel Touch Squats (use “kickstand” if needed)Alt. Sprinter Lunges Plyo Sprinter Lunges (jump from higher position if more beginner)4. UPPER PULL (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Pullups OR Seated PullupsHuman Pullovers OR BW Sliding PulldownsInverted Chin Curls5. ABS (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Reverse CorkscrewsBlack Widow Knee SlidesLevitation Crunches6. CORRECTIVE (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)Angels and DevilsCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)Here is how to construct the perfect home workout B:HINGE / POSTERIOR x 3 ROUNDSSlick Floor Bridge Curl (Single Leg) OR Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Dual Leg)Long Leg MarchHigh Hip BucksLUNGE / ANTERIOR x 3 ROUNDSAlt. Crossover Step UpsAlt. Reverse LungesSplit Squat JumpsUPPER PUSH x 3 ROUNDSVariable Wall Pushups OR Knee Decline Pushups to Knee Flat PushupsAlt. BW Side Lateral Raises (from knees for beginners)Tricep BW Extensions (long head stretch)UPPER PULL x 3 ROUNDSChin Ups OR Seated Chin UpsInverted RowsBack WidowsABS x 2 ROUNDSAb HalosV-Up TucksSit-Up Elbow ThrustsCORRECTIVE x 2 ROUNDSReverse HypersCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)If you are doing this workout just to try it out, then I would suggest you choose the workout A variation. That said, if you opt to do a more comprehensive total body split workout routine then you will want to either incorporate workouts A and B into a twice a week plan or, even better, alternating A and B on M, W and F each week.For a complete 6 week home workout plan, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below to get the athlean xero program.

Authorities here have decided to close borders with Switzerland and Austria. That's according to German media reports. Added restrictions are also being imposed on the French-German boundary. Spain is in lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus Covid-19. Unprecedented lockdowns and border closures are coming into effect in many European countries, and the streets are empty throughout Europe, with Spain and France among the worst hit by the virus' spread behind Italy. England is planning self-isolation measures for all people over 70, for up to four months. Austria's Chancellor Sebstian Kurz says his government is banning gatherings of more than five people. Iran's coronavirus death toll has leapt by 113 in one day to reach 724. And the Vatican says all Easter services will take place without worshipers in attendance. Pope Francis will hold Sunday blessings via TV and the internet. Meanwhile, the United States has tightened its ban on visitors from Europe. President Donald Trump says it will now include travelers from Britain and Ireland. In countries that are far away from coronavirus hotspots, like Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, the response from authorities has ranged from tough to nonexistent.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dw_stories/Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#Coronavirus #Covid19 #dwNews"

He sees his music as therapeutic, not just for him, but for anyone who comes in contact with it.As genuine a modern day outlaw as you can get, Jelly's music incorporates influences ranging from Southern Rock to Dirty South rap. With his forthcoming album, A Beautiful Disaster, Jelly Roll draws you in with his ability to tell a story that you didn't even know you were a part of. With songs like Creature, I Need You, Nothing Left At All and the dark, haunting love story Suicide along with features from the likes of Tech N9ne, Struggle Jennings, Krizz Kaliko and Lil Wyte, A Beautiful Disaster gives you a direct link to the life of Jelly Roll - the trials and tribulations, along with the celebrations and victories."

Joe Gardner is about to find his. Watch the new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s Soul, in theaters June 19. About Soul: Joe Gardner is a middle-school band teacher who gets the chance of a lifetime to play at the best jazz club in town. But one small misstep takes him from the streets of New York City to The Great Before – a fantastical place where new souls get their personalities, quirks and interests before they go to Earth. Determined to return to his life, Joe teams up with a precocious soul, 22, who has never understood the appeal of the human experience. As Joe desperately tries to show 22 what’s great about living, he may just discover the answers to some of life’s most important questions. Featuring the voices of Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Phylicia Rashad, Angela Bassett, Ahmir Questlove Thompson, Daveed Diggs, “Soul” is directed by Academy Award® winner Pete Docter (“Inside Out,” “Up”), co-directed by Kemp Powers (“One Night in Miami”) and produced by Academy Award nominee Dana Murray (Pixar short “Lou”). Globally renowned musician Jon Batiste will be writing original jazz music for the film, and Oscar®-winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (“The Social Network”), from Nine Inch Nails, will compose an original score that will drift between the real and soul worlds.  Facebook: http://facebook.com/pixarsoul/Twitter: http://twitter.com/pixarsoulInstagram: http://instagram.com/pixarsoul/Hashtag: #PixarSoul"

Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.While this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.  If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5IExtrapolation xkcd: https://xkcd.com/605/------------------These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manimIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.Music by Vincent Rubinetti.Download the music on Bandcamp:https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brownStream the music on Spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5uIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then add subtitles/cc.

The food, people, culture, and ancient bazaar were all the highlights. In this video, we take you on a Iranian street food tour of the ancient bazaar of Tabriz. #Iran #Tabriz #streetfoodBazaar of Tabriz - A UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East, it’s also one of the best preserved and most authentic. What was amazing to me is how it’s still in full functioning use, still used in much of the same exact way as its been used for hundreds of years. There are sections of the bazaar for everything - from spices and food, clothes and woodwork. But one of the most fascinating parts of the bazaar is the carpets bazaar, where you’ll find some of the best hand made Persian carpets in the world. Tabriz is known around the world for its exquisite carpet making.Tabriz Central Mosque - Bazaar of Tabriz - In addition to the amazing Iranian food, we also visited the Tabriz Central Mosque.Haj Ali Kebab - One of the most famous and best restaurants in Tabriz is Haj Ali Kebab, where you’ll find some of the best kebabs in Tabriz. The kebabs were so incredibly juicy, especially with Persian style butter rice, and some roasted tomatoes and sumac. It was a wonderful lunch within the ancient bazaar.Shazdeh Restaurant - Along with plenty of street food snacks, our final Iranian food meal at the bazaar was at Shazdeh Restaurant, and one dish you can’t miss are the kufta Tabrizi, one of the ultimate dishes of Tabriz.It was an amazing day, and a throwback in time, learning about and discovering the ancient bazaar of Tabriz, Iran!Thank you to Ghasr Setareh (https://www.instagram.com/ghasr_setareh/) for arranging our trip to Iran.Friends in the video:Mr. Taster: https://www.instagram.com/mr.taster/Persia Tour Guide: https://www.instagram.com/persiatourguide/Rambod: https://www.instagram.com/rambod_rastegar/Ali: https://www.instagram.com/alimojarad/🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdohttps://www.audionetwork.com/——————————————————🍌Banana Chips are available now worldwide!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/📷Camera gear I use:https://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful –a small minority.”  This video explains how the people of China are themselves victims of the conditions that led to coronavirus. The virus is affecting many different countries and cultures, and there is never justification for xenophobia or racism.You can find further reading on this on Vox:  https://www.vox.com/2020/2/7/21126758/coronavirus-xenophobia-racism-china-asianshttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/4/21157825/coronavirus-pandemic-xenophobia-racismhttps://www.vox.com/identities/2020/3/6/21166625/coronavirus-photos-racismAs of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.Both SARS and COVID-19 are in the coronavirus family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge.
