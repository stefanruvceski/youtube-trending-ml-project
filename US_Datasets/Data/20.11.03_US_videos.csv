FOX News also produces FOX News Sunday on FOX Broadcasting Company and FOX News Edge. A top five-cable network, FNC has been the most watched news channel in the country for 17 consecutive years. According to a 2018 Research Intelligencer study by Brand Keys, FOX News ranks as the second most trusted television brand in the country.

Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.While this video uses COVID-19 (what we're all calling Coronavirus) as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.  If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5IExtrapolation xkcd: https://xkcd.com/605/------------------These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manimIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.Music by Vincent Rubinetti.Download the music on Bandcamp:https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brownStream the music on Spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5uIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then add subtitles/cc.

In this video, I’m going to show you 8 bodyweight exercises you’ll want to stop doing, and more importantly, the exercise substitutions you should make to keep the gains coming and prevent injury from doing the wrong things.We start with the popular bench dip. The reason people do this exercise for their triceps is to get a complete contraction on the muscle by getting the arm behind the body which allows for better activation of the triceps long head. The issue here is the position of the shoulder that many assume just to get in position to perform it. The head of the humerus is thrown anteriorly, which stretches and weakens the anterior shoulder capsule (an area already chronically weak and unstable on many). You can either vary the hand position as shown or switch to the cobra pushup as a way to get the same tricep benefits without the shoulder joint compromise.Next we have the popular plank. Now, while this is a core exercise performed by many it doesn’t mean that it’s a good one. Besides the fact that it is entirely remedial for almost everyone that does it (not providing nearly enough of a core challenge to adequately stimulate or strengthen your core muscles) it also tends to reinforce some postural imbalances that are already all too common, with the posterior chain muscles getting too little stimulation in favor of the anterior chain. See the plank alternatives in the video linked at the end of this video.The hurdler’s hamstring stretch is not at all the best way to stretch your hamstrings. Many will perform it but not understand why it’s so ineffective for creating actual length increases of the hamstring muscles. The issue is the amount of posterior pelvic tilt that occurs when you perform it. When this happens the hamstrings are put on slack and the stretch is greatly minimized. Instead, either do so out of a taller posture where the pelvis is rotated anteriorly or try the standing hamstring wall stretch for a much better effect.Neck bridges are just not something you want to do to your neck. Yes, they are incredibly effective for creating overload and developing larger neck muscles, but at what expense. You only get one set of cervical vertebra in your lifetime. Protect them. Avoid the compression and shearing stresses piled on your discs with this exercise in favor of the flexion and extension isometrics shown.Kipping pullups are not pullups. No further discussion needed!Scorpions are performed to increase spinal mobility and movement. The problem is, increased lumbar rotation is not something you should be aspiring to create. The lumber spine is designed to be stable. Mobility in the area should come from the hips not the low back. Instead, opt for the t-spine mobility drill shown here to attack the area most capable of giving you the rotation that you seek.Sissy squats are another bad bodyweight exercise you should avoid. It’s not so much the knees over toes that is the issue but that it is combined with the extra stretch on the quads from above that creates a tremendous amount of stress on the quadriceps and patellar tendons. Opt for a single leg modified pistol squat instead.Finally, while popular, the pushup is one of the most often misperformed bodyweight exercises around. Be sure not to cut the range of motion even a few inches here if you want to see the real benefits of the exercise.For a complete workout program where all of the exercises are selected based on science, be sure to head to athleanx.com at the link below to see how to train like an athlete and look like one in just a few months of proper training.

The food, people, culture, and ancient bazaar were all the highlights. In this video, we take you on a Iranian street food tour of the ancient bazaar of Tabriz. #Iran #Tabriz #streetfoodBazaar of Tabriz - A UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East, it’s also one of the best preserved and most authentic. What was amazing to me is how it’s still in full functioning use, still used in much of the same exact way as its been used for hundreds of years. There are sections of the bazaar for everything - from spices and food, clothes and woodwork. But one of the most fascinating parts of the bazaar is the carpets bazaar, where you’ll find some of the best hand made Persian carpets in the world. Tabriz is known around the world for its exquisite carpet making.Tabriz Central Mosque - Bazaar of Tabriz - In addition to the amazing Iranian food, we also visited the Tabriz Central Mosque.Haj Ali Kebab - One of the most famous and best restaurants in Tabriz is Haj Ali Kebab, where you’ll find some of the best kebabs in Tabriz. The kebabs were so incredibly juicy, especially with Persian style butter rice, and some roasted tomatoes and sumac. It was a wonderful lunch within the ancient bazaar.Shazdeh Restaurant - Along with plenty of street food snacks, our final Iranian food meal at the bazaar was at Shazdeh Restaurant, and one dish you can’t miss are the kufta Tabrizi, one of the ultimate dishes of Tabriz.It was an amazing day, and a throwback in time, learning about and discovering the ancient bazaar of Tabriz, Iran!Thank you to Ghasr Setareh (https://www.instagram.com/ghasr_setareh/) for arranging our trip to Iran.Friends in the video:Mr. Taster: https://www.instagram.com/mr.taster/Persia Tour Guide: https://www.instagram.com/persiatourguide/Rambod: https://www.instagram.com/rambod_rastegar/Ali: https://www.instagram.com/alimojarad/🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdohttps://www.audionetwork.com/——————————————————🍌Banana Chips are available now worldwide!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/📷Camera gear I use:https://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.Both SARS and COVID-19 are in the coronavirus family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge.

Today I am going to be decorating and painting all the outlet covers in my art/craft room. Have I lost it? No....well.....maybe? This was fun though. I used a combination of spray paint and posca paint pens.

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUMSpecial thanks to:Prof. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.comHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches.

Born and raised in L.A., the 24-year-old self-taught singer-rapper behind “Candy” is a vet of sorts. The arts were central to her upbringing, and she started sharing her music on Soundcloud back in 2013. A year later she dropped her much-buzzed-about ‘Purrr!’ EP, and since she’s nurtured an ever-growing array of feverish fans who revere her for combining a radiant charisma with a unique flow and tongue-in-cheek lyrics (see: the irresistible“MOOO!”). Seems like Doja has designed her version of alt-R&B to take off in any direction she chooses. Tours with Lizzo and Theophilius London led right into 2018’s impressive ‘Amala’ debut, followed by last year’s ‘Hot Pink.’ That album’s “Say So” is currently clocking big numbers. Arresting visuals help. Her videos for “Rules,” and “Say So” are wildly fun. Ditto for the hyper footage from ‘Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey’ that makes a nice parallel to Doja’s “Boss Bitch” track. When the Vevo production team united with the feline phenom to figure out performance ideas, the creative juices were flowing. The goal? Put the “cat” in Doja Cat - a decision that resulted in what’s probably our most ambitious studio build to date for a LIFT performance. For “Streets,” we built a massive bowl of milk. Doja hopped in that 2% and bodied the beat - clearly in her element. Time to wet your whiskers, and if this one’s not wild enough for ya, stay tuned: another performance and short film are on their way.

Serving as executive producers are Adam Sztykiel, Charles Roven, Richard Suckle, Jesse Ehrman, Dan Povenmire, and Chris Columbus.  The screenplay is by Adam Sztykiel and Jack C.

But he told lawmakers Thursday they cannot stop the virus.   We've never suggested we were capable of doing that, Ken Cuccinelli told the Senate Homeland Security Committee during a hearing on administration efforts to fight the spread of the virus. Cuccinelli said Customs and Border Patrol and Homeland Security are putting increased resources on the ports of entries on the northern and southern U.S. borders to stop any potential travelers with the virus from entering the country. He said officials have already barred some 300 people trying to cross into the United States due to virus concerns. Those people were primarily Canadians who had traveled to China, with the second largest group being Chinese nationals. We have been very aware of it and confronting it head on and turning those folks back, frankly, Cuccinelli said.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6634129/coronavirus-pushes-west/Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#Coronavirus #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #GlobalNews"
