A few months ago, I found out that Amazon started offering a personal shopping service. That's right, Amazon was styling people for a small fee each month - so I figured, we had to try it out to see what kind of clothing & accessories they would send me, and if they would be any good. So we took a quiz and good ole' Bezos sent me a sack of clothes. What do you guys think of my Amazon personal shopper haul? EDIT (for clarity) - although I eliminated most color options in the quiz, I did leave on every pattern except animal print, I said that I often wear edgy styles and I also liked boho styles, said that I would try pretty much every trend except for animal print and cropped pants, and clicked yes on multiple silhouettes and clothing items - so they had plenty of optionality! just in case you guys missed some answers!This video is NOT sponsored!You can check out our Colourpop frankenlipsticks here! https://colourpop.com/collections/safiya-nygaard-makeupSafiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/Check out our merch here: https://fiendsbysaf.com/If your size is sold out, sign up for email updates!MUSICVia AudioNetworkAssistant EditorsEmily Linden & Josie Latino"

They don’t know where they are, or how they got there. They don't know they’ve been chosen… for a very specific purpose … The Hunt. In the shadow of a dark internet conspiracy theory, a group of elites gathers for the very first time at a remote Manor House to hunt ordinary Americans for sport. But the elites’ master plan is about to be derailed because one of The Hunted, Crystal (Betty Gilpin, GLOW), knows The Hunters’ game better than they do. She turns the tables on the killers, picking them off, one by one, as she makes her way toward the mysterious woman (two-time Oscar® winner Hilary Swank) at the center of it all. From Jason Blum, the producer of Get Out and The Purge series, and Damon Lindelof, creator of the HBO series Watchmen and co-creator of the TV series Lost, comes a timely and provocative new satirical thriller that has already ignited a national conversation. Now, it’s time to decide for yourself. The Hunt is written by Lindelof and his fellow Watchmen collaborator Nick Cuse and is directed by Craig Zobel (Z for Zachariah, The Leftovers). Blum produces for his Blumhouse Productions alongside Lindelof. The film is executive produced by Zobel, Cuse and Steven R. Molen."

They’re all important parts of the tale of the axion - a tale whose end may take us beyond the standard model and solve one of the most vexing mysteries in astrophysics. Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'Dowd & Graeme GosselGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealPost Production: Yago Ballarini, Max Willians, Pedro OsinskiDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberThe story of the axion is a classic physics tale: intrepid scientists delve deep into trackless mathematics in search of answers to a mystery. And there, against all expectations, they find the hint of a completely new and unexpected denizen of the natural world. In this case the mystery was a subtle inconsistency in the behavior of the fundamental forces. And the unexpected discovery?

Now. Because this was a surprise performance and… it’s not 2003, many people were caught off guard.In fact, at the award show, the camera panned over to a few celebrities that shared exactly how they were feeling about this surprise, through their faces alone. Starting off, with Indina Menzel. Who, honestly, just looked perplexed.Then of course there was Martin Scorsese who appeared to be so relaxed by the performance that he started to fall asleep.And lastly, there was Billie Eillish and her brother Fineas, who both, similar to Indina, looked absolutely baffled.Follow:http://www.twitter.com/reneearielhttp://www.instagram.com/reneearielhttp://www.twitter.com/fionazaringhttp://www.instagram.com/fionazaringSharing is Caring..."

We bought the Rs1 to surprise our friend Big Ken with it for his birthday and also because we haven't gotten him something to thank him for everything he does too... and also cause we wanted one at the shop hahaha. We rip it around our neighborhood for awhile and then take it out on the snowmobile trails in the ditches to see how the suspension handles. Very quickly into that Micah Rolls the Polaris Rs1 crashing it. Luckily there was no damage. Ben then tests his New Ford Raptor's offroad capabilities by taking it on the same trails that we had our RS1 on but the raptor was too heavy and ends up falling through the snow and getting stuck lol. Comment down below what you would like to see us get on the new RS1 and also if you read all this comment Get a turbo for it"

He was suffering from a rare form of liver cancer and doctors had given up hope. After hearing his story, I knew I wanted to meet him. Little did I know Xavier would beat all the odds and that we would get to know each other and become brothers. Over three months of getting to know him, he taught me about what it means to fight for your life, to love unconditionally and to appreciate every single breath. He always wanted to start a YouTube channel and I told him that no matter what, his story would be told. He took comfort in that. Here is that story. I know he's here with us. I know he's watching this video and smiling at these beautiful moments we got to spend with each other. I miss him and I know I'll see him again one day. Thank you for watching.

I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReviewAs they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

This is What Happened to Her Brain. ►  https://youtu.be/J3HivpHP-5IA Woman Drank 1 Liter Soy Sauce In 2 Hours. This Is What Happened To Her Brain. ► https://youtu.be/QiBpKuTrFrwThis is a case of beer potomania, which is a very specific case of hypotonic hyponatremia. Humans need solute in order to produce urine. These solutes are predominantly sodium, potassium and urea, along with others. Beer contains little to no sodium or potassium. Drinking only 50 beers daily for weeks causes solute loss, on top of vitamin deficiency and poor nutrition.Slowly as sodium is depleted, more volume from beer is accumulated in the body.Beer contains water, alcohol and carbohydrates, the latter which induces an insulin response in the body to prevent muscle catabolism.Muscle catabolism could count as protein that would produce urea, but because of insulin response, it doesn't happen, further exacerbating solute loss.The accumulation of water in the body and depletion of solute leads to chronic hyponatremia. This is because the kidneys need solute exchange in the process of urine production. If these solutes are absent, minimal urine is produced, and the urine that is produced is maximally dilute (eg low specific gravity) Neurologic sequelae from low sodium presence in blood include seizures and is an emergency.In this patient, it wasn't clear whether he was suffering withdrawal syndrome, chronic hyponatremia, or both. In the case as it happened, the hospital ran out of medicines for the SE because it was so frequent, and needed to borrow twice from neighboring hospitals.Osmotic demyelination syndrome appears to have a higher risk in patients who have more electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic derangements. Please see references for more information.These cases are patients who I, or my colleagues have seen. They are de-identified and many instances have been presented in more depth in an academic setting. These videos are not individual medical advice and are for general educational purposes only.

Working in the shadow of an esteemed police veteran (Samuel L.
