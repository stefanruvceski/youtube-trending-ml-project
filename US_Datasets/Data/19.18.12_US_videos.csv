Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! One day, Beck received a message from her friend about someone she should add on social media. Beck didn't know the person, but her friend told her that if she connected with him, he would give her free money online. Beck decided to go for it - the idea of free money got her really excited. When she added the man, he started messaging her and offering her money right away. He promised to treat her right, but then he started asking her weird questions. He asked her for her shoe size, height, age - lots of personal details about Beck. Beck responded, but she gave him fake information. Then, the man asked Beck for inappropriate pictures she wasn't comfortable with. When she denied his request, he responded by saying that he would still give her the money if she sent his profile to 5 of her friends that were girls - they HAD to be girls. The promise of free money was too hard for her to pass up, so she sent his information to some friends. Some of her friends thought it was sketchy and didn't add him, but some of them did. When it was time for Beck to get the money he promised her, he asked her for her address. Then, at that moment, Beck made a big mistake - she sent him her REAL address. Beck's friends freaked out and started telling him that her address was fake, which made him extremely angry. He started sending Beck scary, threatening messages. At that point, Beck realized she made a huge mistake. Beck decided to show her school officer the messages and screen shots, and Beck's school decided to call the police. Beck was even more upset when the police told her that the man she was talking to was likely a criminal, and the whole situation was really scary for her. She regretted giving out any personal information, and the entire experience taught her what it means to stay safe online.When she looks back now, she can say to herself, A stranger offered me money on social media - and it taught me an important lesson.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

Break it up in the pan then let it sit until a crust starts to form, then flip and do the same thing again Dice a large onion and chop it up Do the same with three cloves of garlicHeat your chili pot on medium with some olive oil then saut√© the onion until it starts to brownThrow the garlic in during the last couple of minutesThen add the beef with a teaspoon of salt and break it up moreAdd in 28oz/790g crushed tomatoes2 tablespoon chili powder1 tablespoon cumin 1 to 1.5 cups beef broth‚Ä¶adjust as necessary ¬Ω tablespoon of brown sugar15.5oz/439g chatty bastard kidney beansThen add hot sauce or more spice as desired. Then add toppings, which don‚Äôt count as chili ingredients, because they are on top, not inside. They‚Äôre not really a part of the chili. The chili is it‚Äôs own thing. It‚Äôs like calling ketchup a hot dog. Ketchup isn‚Äôt a hot dog. It‚Äôs ketchup. It has it‚Äôs own life. Don‚Äôt argue with me here. It will get you nowhere and it will just waste both of our times.

Why, for example, are the fundamental constants - like the mass of the electron or the strength of the forces - just right for the emergence of life? Tweak them too much and life, stars, galaxies, the universe as we know it wouldn‚Äôt exist. In recent episodes we explored one possible explanation for this - the anthropic principle and the idea of the multiverse. If there are countless universes with different fundamental constants, then it‚Äôs not surprising that a few exist with the right numbers for life - and certainly not surprising that we find ourselves in one of those good ones. But if you don‚Äôt like the anthropic principle - and many scientists don‚Äôt - then rest assured, there‚Äôs an alternative. You only need to accept two things: that our universe formed inside a black hole, and that universes can evolve.Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'DowdGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberSpecial Thanks to our Patreon Sponsors: Big BangAndrew & BrennaAlexander TamasCraig StonahaDavid BarnholdtDavid NicklasFabrice EapJohn SJuan BenetMorgan HoughQuasarMark HeisingVinnie FalcoHypernovaChuck ZegarDanton SpiveyDonal BotkinEdmund FokschanerHank SJohn HofmannJohn PollockJohn R.

Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. This led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   But the big picture conceals  the details. Let us look at one region in particular: Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. So is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?

At the intersection of it all is the likeable, magnetic bodega owner Usnavi (Anthony Ramos), who saves every penny from his daily grind as he hopes, imagines and sings about a better life.  ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù fuses Lin-Manuel Miranda‚Äôs kinetic music and lyrics with director Jon M. Chu‚Äôs lively and authentic eye for storytelling to capture a world very much of its place, but universal in its experience. ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù stars Anthony Ramos (‚ÄúA Star is Born,‚Äù Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù), Corey Hawkins (‚ÄúStraight Outta Compton,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlacKkKlansman‚Äù), singer/songwriter Leslie Grace, Melissa Barrera (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúVida‚Äù), Olga Merediz (Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù), Daphne Rubin-Vega (Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúRent‚Äù), Gregory Diaz IV (Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúMatilda the Musical‚Äù), Stephanie Beatriz (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrooklyn Nine-Nine‚Äù), Dascha Polanco (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúOrange is the New Black‚Äù) and Jimmy Smits (the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù films). Chu is directing the film from a screenplay by Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes; it is based on the musical stage play, with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, book by Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes and concept by Miranda. ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù is produced by Miranda and Hudes, together with Scott Sanders, Anthony Bregman and Mara Jacobs. David Nicksay and Kevin McCormick served as executive producers. Behind the camera, Chu is reuniting with his ‚ÄúCrazy Rich Asians‚Äù production designer, Nelson Coates, and editor, Myron Kerstein. He is also collaborating with director of photography Alice Brooks (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù) and costume designer Mitchell Travers (‚ÄúEighth Grade‚Äù).  The choreography is by Christopher Scott, who previously teamed with Chu on the award-winning ‚ÄúThe Legion of Extraordinary Dancers.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù was filmed in New York, primarily on location in the dynamic community of Washington Heights.  Slated for release on June 26, 2020, it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures."
