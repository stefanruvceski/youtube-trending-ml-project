Summer 2020 is the time for F9, the ninth chapter in the saga that has endured for almost two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  Vin Diesel‚Äôs Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he‚Äôs going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they‚Äôve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom‚Äôs forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, next year‚Äôs The Suicide Squad). F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe‚Äîfrom London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tblisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom‚Äôs past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent.  www.thefastsaga.com"

This movie made over a billion dollars. This movie is a certified box office bonanza. The critics didn't seem to dig it, but it's got pretty decent fan scores on some websites. The real question is... does it have sins? And you bet your ass it does. It really does. Up next: Modern classic crime sins and modern classic thriller sins.Remember, no movie is without sin! Which movie's sins should we expose next?!Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CinemaSins Podcast: https://soundcloud.com/cinemasins TVSins: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe4bOvc1mYxFcQ5xPb9Zmow MusicVideoSins: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBq8oBRVTsMpjWiHfjJpDw Twitters...Jeremy: http://twitter.com/cinemasins Barrett: http://twitter.com/musicvideosins Aaron: http://twitter.com/aarondicer Jonathan: http://twitter.com/samloomis13 Denee: http://twitter.com/deneesaysMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/cinemasins-storeSubreddit: http://reddit.com/r/cinemasins Website: http://cinemasins.com SinCast Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/SinCastCinemaSins#CinemaSins#EverythingWrongWith#Joker"

However, as the city, located in central China's Hubei Province, is now hosting the vast majority of the confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, medical staff across hospitals in Wuhan have faced up to their responsibilities regardless of the risks and sacrifices.On the early morning of Saturday, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the country's grandest traditional festival that was supposed to be filled with fun activities and events, doctors and nurses from the Jinyintan Hospital did not even have time to take a rest.Ding Na is a nurse working in the ICU of the hospital, one that has been at the frontier of the battle for nearly a month since it took in the first infected patient on Dec 29 last year.Her husband is a physician who works on a different floor in the same building. However, over the past 28 days, they did not quite have any chance to meet each other nor much time to rest at home.This has lead to the husband's locker becoming a mail box for the couple to keep in touch and care for each other.I come here every day to bring him tidy clothes here and take away the dirty ones home, as she told the China Central Television (CCTV) reporter.Knowing well about the threat they faced in the fight against the virus better than anyone, the medical workers have still chosen to stick to their duties and try their best to free the patients away from the pain.I hope with our efforts, we are able to control the epidemic at an earlier date so that none of our families, colleagues, friends and fellow citizens suffer anymore, said Guo Wei, deputy head of infection division from Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Today I am doing a 24 hour challenge AGAIN. BUT, this time, I wanted to make it a little more interesting. I am not too big on challenges on my channel, just because I can't compete with the extreme challenges that so many other youtubers are willing to do LOL. I just like painting on things üòÇ PLUS, I feel like a lot of challenges these days have gotten really pointless. But, this one is good haha. I decided to try  to paint and decorate different things for 24 hours. I have a lot of art supplies laying around my art room, just begging to be painted. But I don't often have the time to paint that much at a time. So this was a great opportunity to put a bunch of it to good use finally.I am going to be painting on a seashell, painting a pencil pouch, painting a rock, painting a squishy (mini squishy makeover lol), making a custom mug, decorating a giant clothes pin and a surprise weird item LOL.

But the individual feud between those two wasn't just a battle within that war. It was personal. It was beef.Starting with his trade to the Pistons in the early 1980s, Laimbeer built a reputation as not just a strong rebounder and scorer, but a relentless pest. On one hand, he'd make dirty and dangerous plays, then act like nothing had happened. On the other hand, he'd flop and whine to bait the referees into calling fouls on his opponents. Nobody despised Laimbeer for this quite as much as Bird did. Bird's public campaign against Laimbeer's style of play dated back to the Celtics-Pistons playoff series in 1985, and really took off after Laimbeer started a brawl by fouling Bird hard in the 1987 playoffs. Bird accused Laimbeer of intentionally trying to injure him, and never withdrew the accusation. Even decades later, these two NBA legends maintain an icy distance because of how things played out on the court. This beef might never end, so in this episode, we learn about what built it.Written and produced by Seth RosenthalDirected and edited by Jiazhen ZhangSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com"

In a globalised world, how might such an outbreak be contained?We‚Äôve had similar scares before, with SARS in 2003, bird flu in 2006, swine flu in 2009, and even Ebola and Zika. What are the plans in place to act against a major threat?  The World Health Organization has said it's too early to term the outbreak of coronavirus an international public health emergency. It also doesn't fulfil the criteria for a pandemic, which is a spread worldwide of a new disease.
