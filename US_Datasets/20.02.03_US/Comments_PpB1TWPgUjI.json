It is very much conditional because I know I would be more accepted and loved if I were not atheist and if I were heterosexual and well, if I wasn't me. We are all more than the sum of our parts. But those are two very important parts of my identity that were hard fought for. Watching a loved one continually choose blind faith over you, their child is an incredibly awful feeling. I get not really being surprised by their actions, but more so your reaction to it. Of course that shit still hurts though. Thanks for sharing such intimate parts of you. I'm proud of you, Hannah. I respect the shit out of you.
