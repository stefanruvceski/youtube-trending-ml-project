GET OUT, les estoy hablando desde Bogot\u00e1 Colombia, I've been outside my country only one time and it was enough to understand the impact that a tv personality can do, this whole section of the show was a huge problem just passing by someone's (her) shoulders and not leaving a clear mark on what people should do. Black people, yes, I'm aware you might have suffered throughout the years and have stories of awful kind to share and learn from, but if you guys are preaching love and change, her words were not close to lead a movement of consciousness and tolerance. I love the show, I love your ladies, but for the longest time I have struggled with her opinions, and I don't usually participate in this community but this topic hit hard because I've felt multiple times and I myself consider that I use my life to say nothing else but words that would route anyone or anything wherever I go to a better place. I don't think that ladie has a quality of speech to be sitting so frequently, it's sad and disappointing to see how Jeannie is clearly professional yet so affected while she explained the topic and just get a pad on the back. This is very upsetting to me. But hey, I'm on the other side of America, I just really hope that despite all the careless moments during this show, there would be a space to remember how deep and important things were and not how cute you were looking while you just displayed your answer on the table.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-02T03:33:21.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-02T03:34:39.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/SPYvuxYsa9ZmPmE-CKUh5mMsOVU\"", "id": "Ugy8WSwG0myTH8zr7zF4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "I-GHGDnHVsM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/adp0PnA80_KBqKUGqRkRXO5MBG4\"", "id": "Ugy8WSwG0myTH8zr7zF4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Dirk Diggler", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJywk5MIF6Dq9ucbSLUnuX3In_tp5awQr0HM3w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54eXcTDFwrthvTzFNa50rA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC54eXcTDFwrthvTzFNa50rA"}, "videoId": "I-GHGDnHVsM", "textDisplay": "What the hell is Erykah Badu talking about \ud83d\ude06", "textOriginal": "What the hell is Erykah Badu talking about \ud83d\ude06", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-02T02:37:59.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-02T02:37:59.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/8JxONfhLuylgPFao4H8kWcvE3aU\"", "id": "Ugxc00yr3Sx1Yph8qAt4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "I-GHGDnHVsM", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"SJZWTG6xR0eGuCOh2bX6w3s4F94/nvli4e0htvplUnEwr8CqMrbJ8Ho\"", "id": "Ugxc00yr3Sx1Yph8qAt4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Stephanie Bailey", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzzCa67-2wGH6LsOvVyW4oW6gM7Bb8BwNr3cw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoMVNCoHXi9iGVy1B7Kakqw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoMVNCoHXi9iGVy1B7Kakqw"}, "videoId": "I-GHGDnHVsM", "textDisplay": "Most Asians hate black people.
