(NY Dolls, Bowie, Eno, Roxy, SAHB, Mike McGeer, Mott the Hoople, etc. Gave us an excuse to go to across the border into another &quot;territory&quot;.- and to meet &quot;better people, better food, better BEER&quot;) So Detroit, Cleveland and several other Great Lakes-industrial towns became early roosts for the band to visit.

The owner/manager, Paul &quot;Cowboy&quot; Smith was a friend of my oldest brother owned and ran Pyramid Guitars. And their was other times, but that is another &quot;story/comment for another time.  I got to meet Neil when during the Hemispheres tour, he did a rare interview at a local rock station. When he finished, he was cordial in answering questions from everyone and nobody fawned over him-true Rush fans! I asked him questions that our drummer wanted to ask him about his kit. And this was the all analog one. I love saying the word &quot;glockenspiel&quot;. He signed my poster that came with the record. We all thanked him and he replied &quot;See you guys at the show&quot;. When he got into the car, he opened a brief case to put away a manila envelope, and at that precise moment at least a 20 or more joints flew into the window and into the briefcase and his lap. He and the driver (Skip or Liam) starting laughing and Neil was just like &quot;Oh wow- you guys are so generous!&quot; &quot;Thank You&quot; in several languages, and &quot;The crew will be happy.&quot;, etc. They pulled away and came to a stop after a few seconds and the driver rightfully put the briefcase in the trunk!  And Neil was riding in incognito-no hoi-palloi limo. We all kind of snickered at a slightly rusty early 1970&#39;s unibody construction oil burner. You could tell that  it was a unibody because it must of been in an accident or slid into a curb or snow drift. It was &quot;dog trotting&quot; because from behind you could see all 4 tires. Then at the concert when Geddy went to intro &quot;Passage To Bangkok&quot;-as &quot;their Public Safety Announcement&quot;, Alex interrupted with &quot;Neil would like to dedicate the song to everyone at this afternoon&#39;s  radio interview&quot;  That was so cool!

The owner/manager, Paul \"Cowboy\" Smith was a friend of my oldest brother owned and ran Pyramid Guitars. And their was other times, but that is another \"story/comment for another time.  I got to meet Neil when during the Hemispheres tour, he did a rare interview at a local rock station. When he finished, he was cordial in answering questions from everyone and nobody fawned over him-true Rush fans! I asked him questions that our drummer wanted to ask him about his kit. And this was the all analog one. I love saying the word \"glockenspiel\". He signed my poster that came with the record. We all thanked him and he replied \"See you guys at the show\". When he got into the car, he opened a brief case to put away a manila envelope, and at that precise moment at least a 20 or more joints flew into the window and into the briefcase and his lap. He and the driver (Skip or Liam) starting laughing and Neil was just like \"Oh wow- you guys are so generous!\" \"Thank You\" in several languages, and \"The crew will be happy.\", etc. They pulled away and came to a stop after a few seconds and the driver rightfully put the briefcase in the trunk!  And Neil was riding in incognito-no hoi-palloi limo. We all kind of snickered at a slightly rusty early 1970's unibody construction oil burner. You could tell that  it was a unibody because it must of been in an accident or slid into a curb or snow drift. It was \"dog trotting\" because from behind you could see all 4 tires. Then at the concert when Geddy went to intro \"Passage To Bangkok\"-as \"their Public Safety Announcement\", Alex interrupted with \"Neil would like to dedicate the song to everyone at this afternoon's  radio interview\"  That was so cool! Where ever in JLA we (the fans that went there) were probably saying \"Wow! That was ME!! From one of our heroes - that will forever remain in our memories.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-17T00:09:23.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-17T00:09:23.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/dbl90fMW_I9dhIh_Dvzzh_twCFc\"", "id": "UgwFPAMesCgyjsNSv-h4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "bmOkTmGnFHc", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/4Hq06PG-Gbr2eONKcr6mugb3guo\"", "id": "UgwFPAMesCgyjsNSv-h4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "BrawnerBandWidth Music", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_5oY-uJKfZ-GlFBaesP_WbPzwznrPdyrjcOw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmQCirzTOS1p3RYUCe85iyg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmQCirzTOS1p3RYUCe85iyg"}, "videoId": "bmOkTmGnFHc", "textDisplay": "Shitty situation", "textOriginal": "Shitty situation", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-16T23:51:20.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-16T23:51:20.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/jWzFGI_R-jiNBNCItqF_DeCk_GQ\"", "id": "Ugxe11Lcdl0BH2ZJH114AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "bmOkTmGnFHc", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/CwHuZD7pwsjt3HHMCJdtfmG2_vY\"", "id": "Ugxe11Lcdl0BH2ZJH114AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "fadedletterslost", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-Qe_bbf83IjgNbMtGrV7dqCja7hgYwghtwEA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCETwtLBSfu9IavCTx-IERfg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCETwtLBSfu9IavCTx-IERfg"}, "videoId": "bmOkTmGnFHc", "textDisplay": "Do a top 20 for Rush songs.", "textOriginal": "Do a top 20 for Rush songs.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-16T21:15:19.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-16T21:15:19.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/2YfReX5rTVxKUaZTmT3mxdeRuDk\"", "id": "Ugw6NMp9nRBrcPgb49V4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "bmOkTmGnFHc", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/aaN80tYmWLPx7XTec77noIc6DCs\"", "id": "Ugw6NMp9nRBrcPgb49V4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Pablo Marmol", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_5VcrWhtYTKCWAU_3sHJnwegWumJMkfcvJDg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0jLJLNQxFchczuhvnSn8BA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0jLJLNQxFchczuhvnSn8BA"}, "videoId": "bmOkTmGnFHc", "textDisplay": "The day that I had in my hands and hear the \u201cChronicles\u201d album, that day change my perception of music Forever.
