way too much of an emphasis, in SW, of somehow the force being limited to one&#39;s own desires. A more powerful force lightning? A healing force, as used by Rey and Kylo? The force is as strong as the wielder is in it&#39;s art. Also, just because you would have never seen the force used to heal, how in the world does that mean it CANNOT???? Just because you don&#39;t like change AT ALL? Well, the force heal was out of nowhere, but as it&#39;s use in Kylo&#39;s case comes at such an extreme price, does it really matter (other than we might wish Rey would go ahead and die)? <br /><br />The Emperor&#39;s extra force lightning makes PERFECT sense, although maybe just a tad too dramatic (but you know how it goes....you idiotically make the super final order fleet in ridiculous numbers, to counter that, you need to make a ridiculous rebel fleet from thin air, to counter that you need another powerful force AKA en masse EMP force lightning, to counter that you need a severely drained Rey to put a mere two light sabers together to cause force bounce?). If you may recall, he had more or less absorbed the power of both Rey and Kylo (which is doubtlessly something incorrect in a number of people&#39;s interpretation of what the force can do) and therefore his force powers would be dramatically enhanced. I mean just adding super Rey&#39;s power of holding up transports was considerable, and then, notice the correlation. It just so happened that when Rey screwed up earlier when under duress from Kylo with the transport, she shoots out a lightning bolt that obliterates it. So add that use of the force to what the Emperor doubtlessly had built upon from ROTJ, and an en masse EMP lightning bolt isn&#39;t exactly too far a stretch (of course adding Kylo&#39;s wimp force power probably was more of a detriment). <br /><br />Unfortunately some of us just want to see virtually everything that is done as illogical, just because there is so much illogic elsewhere, but some things actually work if you bother to think them out, or, at least, aren&#39;t as much of a stretch since you let other failures distort your judgement. I&#39;ll make one more stab at this, in case you don&#39;t notice the flow here. 1. Rey shows lightning bolt strong enough to completely blow up a transport. 2. Emperor builds his power over the years. 3. Emperor absorbs Rey&#39;s force. This is the key point. Rey&#39;s use of lightning was merely an &#39;accident&#39; so the question naturally comes to mind, just what was her lightning power when she was willing to use it fully concentrating? <br /><br />Then consider how if the series went another movie or two, surely she would be a goddess by then, so there you are, the Emperor absorbed powers to the extent nobody has ever seen from her, and as we know, the Dark Side is always stronger to throw another multiplier on there. EMP force lightning over so many ships? Bah, mere child&#39;s play, when you have Supergirl&#39;s power to boost it. And also, Rey&#39;s use of lightning was much stronger than the Emperor&#39;s when you consider she might not had wielded it fully. And the Emperor&#39;s variation could had been massive in effect, but it didn&#39;t result in jack. His form of that bolt, was a much weaker strain despite as powerful as it seemed (yet two lightsabers can deflect it...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.wait a minute here, I&#39;ve found another flaw). <br /><br />Since Rey&#39;s lightning destroys, and Emperor&#39;s goes EMP, and despite that he might had been able to go use destructo bolts instead, he WAS NOT DOING THAT, he was using EMP. Now, EMP has no effect on living beings, correct? So how can it bouncing obliterate him????????????? It would had merely disabled his cell phone. OH, now I think on it further, while his bolt is similar to an EMP. it&#39;s actually MUCH weaker. An EMP will explode and knock out everything electronic, etc, but his had to keep going on, and on, and on. The second he stops, it&#39;s happy time and everything works again. What a croc! And you will notice too, that not a single hair on the rebel fleet was hurt by his bolts, not the ships, not the crews, so HOW COULD HE GET HURT BY IT????????? They stupidly crossed up the Emperor&#39;s prior use of force lightning in this movie, because the old force lightning would have harmed anybody, but in this case, it DON&#39;T harm anything but electronics on rebel ships (That&#39;s another hot one, how does he stop it from hurting final order ships too????) and only as this EMP effect is constantly maintained. The only thing that would make any sense, is he decided to switch to his old force lighting variation once he saw Rey deflecting it, but that is so weak, since the bolts looked the same throughout, and would had required the EMP bolts to stop being continuous and it shut off briefly, only to be replaced by the other. <br /><br />Yes, star destroyers being unable to do anything but small arms fire without directly connected to a leader beacon, or ship, is farce beyond reason! It&#39;s so hilarious for the idiot that wrote this, to make the invincible fleet, only to make another invincible fleet, and then it turns you just need spitwads to destroy the planet destroying gun, to destroy the invincible fleet that can&#39;t ever move on their own. Seriously, this part about the fleet I find FAR, FAR worse than anything involving the force and what it supposedly can and cannot do, because nobody truly knew what the force&#39;s full extent was, but to do this absolute idiocy thoroughly breaking common military practices through the centuries, is just stupidity of the highest order. Well, I guess, that&#39;s what you get when you cater to people who know nothing about much of anything. It must be a new aspect of the feminazi wave we&#39;re experiencing. BTW, could those horses breath in space?

The plot and pacing were off, which I kept noticing as I was watching, but weren&#39;t enough to pull me out. There were a lot of extra characters, some good and others unnecessary. By far, the parts I don&#39;t like most about the sequels in general is the sheer amount of fan service and perhaps the humor too. They simply try too hard and have no sense of subtlety, and it pulls you right out. It was sometimes done okay, but the style simply doesn&#39;t match.<br /><br />It&#39;s clear that the ailments in these sequels come from their poor management and execution, in a most general sense. Everyone had their own ideas and directions, both in the studio and in the theater, which pulled the movies thin in a lot of places where it hurt them, especially as Star wars movies. The vast amount of reestablishment and backtracking in them took its toll. It&#39;s hard to watch all 3 in a row due to the discontinuities.<br /><br />Now, I think most people at this point call the case closed and then double down to point out every single hiccup and error they can find. The debate quickly draws in the people involved in the production, and then everyone tries to sift out who is innocent and guilty. I&#39;m not so quick to jump into that, and here&#39;s why.<br /><br />First of all, before it even went into pre-production, the odds with even episode 7 holding its own were not favorable, let alone a new trilogy. Disney had just inevitably bought Lucasfilm, first and foremost for the properties, with Lucasfilm&#39;s subsidiaries as a bonus. Nothing was going to stop Disney from putting their pen to paper for episode 7. With something this beloved on the line in the hands of Disney itself, dread would be a weak word to use.<br /><br />When episode 7 came out, it was surprisingly respectable for a lot of people. The approach to make it was to take careful steps, tying enough of the old and adding enough new to get at least <b>some</b> result that could hold up despite the odds. A fair amount of things were different from the original films, but anyone expecting otherwise simply didn&#39;t have the right expectations. It works as its own movie. Unfortunately, the seeds needed to carry out a successful trilogy weren&#39;t laid as they should have been, as would become clear.<br /><br />I don&#39;t need to tell the rest of the story, most people reading this know how everything else turned out. In short, episode 8 was quick to abruptly change trajectory while attempting to blend in with the first movie while episode 9 tried to fasten everything back together without trying to hide the fact that nothing was going to be seamless. With the full trilogy finally out, we definitely have something imperfect, stirring up many to reflection of things that could&#39;ve simply been done better.<br /><br />Amid all that has happened and the fallout of clashing and competing creative visions that we were left with, I still really appreciate episode 9, and I think this trilogy truly did okay.  Episode 9 is undoubtedly convoluted, but given the cards it was dealt from 7 and 8 (The disjointed story, the revolt from episode 8, Carrie&#39;s death, being the capstone of both the trilogy and of the entire cinematic saga), I am awed how well they pulled it off. We got the answer to Rey&#39;s origin that somehow pulls together ep 7 and 8, with the writing acrobatics needed to do so is hard to overstate. Before Kylo turns back to the light, he gets to hit a towering climax in his character arc instead of fizzling off, which could easily have happened. Bringing back Palpatine can be seen as a move of desperation, but I think the aim to tie all 9 movies together into a climax of proper magnitude would be otherwise impossible without bringing him in. The way he was brought in related to the stakes/being a threat could&#39;ve been executed better, but tying Palpatine with Rey (THE main character of the trilogy) was the most important decision they could&#39;ve made, and I think it was okay.<br /><br />Episode 8 was my least favorite, but ignoring the parts I don&#39;t like (which sadly is no short list), I can at least watch it and appreciate what I did like about it, and how it fits in.<br /><br />Once we shift from the writing (which is where most of the issues reside), we can see how much love was put into everything else. The set design, world building, props, VFX, SFX, casting, lighting, color grading, soundtrack, and a lot of the technical aspects were done really great. It&#39;s easy to write this off, since it&#39;s 2019, this movie is made by Disney, and the fact that there was plenty to go off of, but that is no reason for me to overlook these.<br /><br />I&#39;ve written a lot, and I know that I could&#39;ve probably demonstrated my points better and more concisely, but I think I&#39;ve been able to expand well on the points I wanted to show.<br /><br />The bottom line is while the sequels could&#39;ve undeniably been so much better, I don&#39;t see the point in endlessly spiraling down into the pit of pointing out everything they did wrong and what they could&#39;ve done instead. Through all of this, the odds were much more difficult than most care to account for, and I think it&#39;s important to recognize that massive effort went in to match sky high expectations, even if everything wasn&#39;t sunshine and roses. Even if they are far from perfect, I think there is plenty to enjoy about them. So while there is no way I will ever want to dumb down my tastes and expectations down to those of an average audience member, I think I can learn from them by at least enjoying the movies without spiraling into the critics&#39; rabbit hole.", "textOriginal": "I enjoyed TROS really well, but I definitely agree with a lot of the points that were made. The plot and pacing were off, which I kept noticing as I was watching, but weren't enough to pull me out. There were a lot of extra characters, some good and others unnecessary. By far, the parts I don't like most about the sequels in general is the sheer amount of fan service and perhaps the humor too. They simply try too hard and have no sense of subtlety, and it pulls you right out. It was sometimes done okay, but the style simply doesn't match.\n\nIt's clear that the ailments in these sequels come from their poor management and execution, in a most general sense. Everyone had their own ideas and directions, both in the studio and in the theater, which pulled the movies thin in a lot of places where it hurt them, especially as Star wars movies. The vast amount of reestablishment and backtracking in them took its toll. It's hard to watch all 3 in a row due to the discontinuities.\n\nNow, I think most people at this point call the case closed and then double down to point out every single hiccup and error they can find.
