I follow you as the primary current source of Star Wars information, but I have never commented before.  Before you, I relied on Ain&#39;t it Cool News and The <a href=\"http://force.net/\">Force.net</a> for my SW info.  Before that there were some message boards going back for me as far as 1995 (I didn&#39;t know how to use a computer before that).  I am not sure how old you are, but while I am not ancient, I think I have a few years on you.  The first Star Wars movie I remember seeing in the theater was Return of the Jedi, I was too young to remember the other two.  Thankfully, I do remember being around at the beginning of home video and that is when I remember seeing all of them.  I also grew up without a TV, but we did have a monitor and VCR and the Star Wars series was among the few movies that I was allowed to watch whenever I wanted to.  I even recorded the original trilogy on cassette tape and listed to them on road trips.<br /><br />Here is a history trip that I bet nobody remembers.  Back in the late 70&#39;s or early 80&#39;s my brother had a book written about Star Wars that compared it to the bible.  Obi-Wan was compared to Jesus, and Darth Vader to the devil.  I don&#39;t remember much of the details, or what my brother ever did with that book, but I know he had it at least until the early 90&#39;s and I would get a kick out of reading that today.<br /><br />Anyways, my point is, I don&#39;t think you are a shill.  My kids became SW fans too, each to different degrees.  We were at lunch today talking about the current movie, but we all agreed that we enjoyed it.  Sure, each of us had some little criticisms, but we also found how it fit perfectly into the overall story.  When I watch your videos, I see someone like myself and my kids.  I think you watch the movies with hope and an open mind and all you are looking for is to enjoy the ride.  That is what I want and why I have enjoyed every SW movie (Even Solo).<br /><br />For those of you haters, I bet you would have help ruin the original trilogy.  If the internet was a big deal in the late 70&#39;s into the 80&#39;s you would have pointed out all the flaws.  Yes, I recognize that there are flaws in the OT.  The ride was fantastic though.  George experimented in the prequel trilogy and some things worked, while some didn&#39;t.  So what.  Go try to make multiple billion dollar blockbusters yourself.  I know I couldn&#39;t do it, and I am sure you can&#39;t either.  I am glad that GL tried his best for 6 movies.  Then he decided that rather than to kill his stories, he would give up his control while giving the stories a chance to live on.  Without that decision we would not have The Mandalorian which I completely enjoy.  Without George&#39;s decision, we would not have as many great minds taking a shot at expanding the story.<br /><br /><br />To the claims of you being a Disney shill during this holiday season, I say Bah, humbug.
