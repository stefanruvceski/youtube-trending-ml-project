IS IT PERSISTENT IN THE AIR?\r<br />We know that the virus is spread by people that are infected via their\r<br />respiratory droplets. These droplets can land around themselves if they cough\r<br />or sneeze, or on people around them nearby. \r<br />The virus can stick to their hands if they touch the fluids in their\r<br />noses or mouth and then be spread to any surface they touch.  Research has shown that the virus can stay\r<br />active on stainless steel and plastic surfaces for about 48 hours or longer, and\r<br />on paper and clothing for about 24 hours [1].\r<br />To minimize that spread we have told the infected to wear masks so the\r<br />viruses in their respiratory droplets are trapped on the mask and do not fly\r<br />out far from themselves. This countermeasure is the mask containment of the\r<br />virus.  We have told people to maintain\r<br />social distance of 6 feet or about 2 meters [2]so when the infected talk and\r<br />breathe without a mask, his/her breath droplets does not reach others around\r<br />them, yet the virus continue to spread very fast, the number of new cases keep\r<br />on doubling almost every 3 days.  \r<br />So, one question comes to mind \u201cIs the virus spreading in another way\r<br />that we have not yet considered? And the answer is more likely, yes.  The virus is spreading through the air and at\r<br />distances more than 6 feet, perhaps as far as 15-30 feet or longer, especially\r<br />when the infected are not wearing masks.\r<br />Let me explain, if the virus remains active on surfaces for as long as\r<br />48 hours, then the virus will stay active for as long as it is protected and cocooned\r<br />in a respiratory droplet that came out of the infected.  When we exhale respiratory droplets near a glass,\r<br />we fog the glass. In winter we can make fog when we breathe.  When we drive in fog one thing you notice is\r<br />that mist does not fall to the ground, it stays floating in the air. Similarly,\r<br />exhale air droplets stays in the air for long time; you do not see them because\r<br />they are not dense enough to fog. The smaller the droplets the buoyant they are,\r<br />they float.  If there is airflow or wind,\r<br />the droplets can travel a long way.  We\r<br />do not know well the electrical polarity of the virus, but it could be that the\r<br />viruses packed inside a water droplet are holding the droplet intact through\r<br />surface tension and the virus owns electrical polarity until that droplet\r<br />touches a surface, breaking and unloading the viruses, like tiny Trojan horses.\r<br />Because these droplets are persistent in the air, people walking by will\r<br />breathe in them; some of the droplets will land on their faces, mouth, eyes,\r<br />ears, contributing to a more extensive spread of covid19.  The more infected that do not adhere to the\r<br />use of masks will be contributing to higher density of the virus in the air.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Let me put things in perspective.  The radius of a coronavirus, from electron\r<br />micrographs [3], is of the order of 0.0000375 mm, the radius of a pin head is\r<br />about 0.75 mm. You can pack a layer of 397 million corona viruses on a pinhead.\r<br />Now an exhaled droplet has a radius of the order of 5 micrometers or 0.005 mm,\r<br />which is about the size of a fog droplet. In this droplet, that floats and\r<br />persists in the air, moves around to distances longer than 2 meter by airflow\r<br />or wind, can carry as much as 2.3 million corona viruses.  Therefore, the virus is hitching rides to vast\r<br />distances by airflow and wind, spreading itself to many more people and\r<br />surfaces other than the surfaces near the infected.\r<br />I propose a simple experiment for the NIH, the CDC and the WHO to\r<br />perform immediately, and it is as follows: \r<br />place an infected person to read a book out loud at the center of a 30\r<br />feet (10 m) wide room for 30 minutes. \r<br />Place some fans to create airflow and simulate wind near the person,\r<br />this will carry his/her exhaled droplets around the room. After 30 minutes take\r<br />sample swabs on the walls, floor, and ceiling and test for the virus.  I am sure the virus will be found on all\r<br />surfaces.  If healthy people stand near\r<br />the walls of the room, they would be breathing in virus particles.  Perhaps the dose is low; nevertheless they\r<br />are being exposed, increasing the transmission of covid19.\r<br />A similar experiment was performed by Jamie Hymeman and Adam Savage in\r<br />an episode of Mythbusters on June 5,2010, titled \u201cThe Art of sneeze\u201d, in which they\r<br />found that droplets from a sneeze can travel as far as 17 feet (5.2 m). In\r<br />another episode called Contamination, using a florescent dye, a person with a\r<br />running nose contaminates everyone in a party of six, by simply serving food,\r<br />drinking and being cordial. Coronarvirus infected droplets should be no\r<br />different. These episode are searchable in YuouTube.  \r<br />How can we prevent the spread of the virus if it is persistent in the\r<br />air?  Everybody mask up, 100% of the\r<br />population must wear a mask, a handkerchief, a scarf,  or whatever to minimized exhale droplets in\r<br />the air. The point is we need to hold the droplets on the mask.  We all have to act as if we are all infected.\r<br />Eventually we all are going to get infected, but this mandatory action will\r<br />reduce the number of infected right away. \r<br />The infection will continue to spread, but it will be gradual.  Our hospitals will be able to handle the sick,\r<br />and many lives will be saved.\r<br />I know some people feel weir wearing a mask in public; they think they\r<br />look sick or not cool. But we have to be creative; we can fashion our own mask out\r<br />of our coolest looking handkerchief or bandana. \r<br />The fashion industry should begin production of masks using dense\r<br />materials. We need to reduce those exhale droplets directly into the air.   \r<br />I was a Nuclear Medical Science Officer with the US Army Public Health\r<br />Command and I did studies on the health effects of airborne depleted uranium particulates.  I have sent this analysis to the Public\r<br />Health Command, the NIH, the CDC and the WHO.  I\r<br />hope they take note of it. The use of masks or other barriers for exhalation must\r<br />be obligatory for all citizens.  This\r<br />will reduce the spread, and it will help our hospitals manage the pandemic, and\r<br />save our economy. With this precaution we might be able to go back to work.\r<br />MAJ (R) Angel Castellanos, Ph.D\r<br />Public Health Command, US Army.\r<br />April 3, 2020.     \r<br />References\r<br />1.

Our hospitals will be able to handle the sick,\r\nand many lives will be saved.\r\nI know some people feel weir wearing a mask in public; they think they\r\nlook sick or not cool. But we have to be creative; we can fashion our own mask out\r\nof our coolest looking handkerchief or bandana. \r\nThe fashion industry should begin production of masks using dense\r\nmaterials. We need to reduce those exhale droplets directly into the air.   \r\nI was a Nuclear Medical Science Officer with the US Army Public Health\r\nCommand and I did studies on the health effects of airborne depleted uranium particulates.  I have sent this analysis to the Public\r\nHealth Command, the NIH, the CDC and the WHO.  I\r\nhope they take note of it. The use of masks or other barriers for exhalation must\r\nbe obligatory for all citizens.  This\r\nwill reduce the spread, and it will help our hospitals manage the pandemic, and\r\nsave our economy. With this precaution we might be able to go back to work.\r\nMAJ (R) Angel Castellanos, Ph.D\r\nPublic Health Command, US Army.\r\nApril 3, 2020.     \r\nReferences\r\n1.   NIH website.
