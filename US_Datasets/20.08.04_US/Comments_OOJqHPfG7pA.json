WHY -<br />IF YOU KNOW GOD ?!<br /><br />For any doctor with a basic education and complete<br />information, it is quite clear that in this case the appearance of the Corone<br />virus to produce mass fear into the dark intentions of the authorities was<br />misused. I am a retired pediatrician who has spent many years in Africa and was<br />directly responsible for viruses that have high mortality rates. E.g. Rota<br />virus.<br /><br /><br /><br />Basic information that everyone needs to know: The<br />Corone virus is one of the many viruses in the Influenza virus group whose<br />trait is spontaneous mutation and arrival in the winter months. The syndrome<br />caused by this group of viruses is the upper and lower respiratory tract<br />syndrome, from rhinitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis to bronchitis and pneumonia.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, this squire of viruses has been visiting the<br />human species for about 150 years every year. The proportion of each type of<br />virus is known, so the proportion of Corona in the flu syndrome is 7-15%. It is<br />no different from other influenza viruses, it does not like the nasal mucosa,<br />so it attacks the pharynx, throat and bronchi more. Flu complications are not a<br />matter of the &quot;badness&quot; of this virus, but of the poor immune status<br />of an infected person, such as chronic debilitating diseases, cancer,<br />cytostatic therapy, many drugs, diabetes \u2026\u2026<br /><br /><br /><br />There are no malicious viruses, but there are<br />immune systems that have been invaded and cannot respond to the virus and kill<br />it. That is why in the winter months more deaths of the elderly and the sick<br />occur in the transition to spring. This is a FORM that has been going on for<br />decades and centuries before us. The people even have their wise sayings for<br />this time of year. That Corona came in 2020 just as she had come all the<br />previous years and how she would have visited us all next years.<br /><br /><br /><br />But this year, the world&#39;s hidden powerlords, the<br />criminals I guarantee you, have decided to bring a play with her that is not in<br />the least naive. They renamed Coron to SARS-Covid-19 BECAUSE THE UNKNOWN DEVICE<br />IS UNKNOWN, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UNKNOWN. TO SAY THAT EPIDEMIA AND PANDEMIA<br />INFLUENZA-PEOPLE WOULDN&#39;T BE AFFECTED AND THEN THEY WOULDN&#39;T IMPLEMENT THE<br />PURPOSE. tied to it - THE SAME AS 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 And EVIL IN<br />POWER IN THE WORLD HAS REMOVED CORON FROM THIS GROUP OF VIRUSES, CHANGE ITS<br />NAME, MAKE AN UNFINISHED TEST AND START TESTING AND PRODUCING HORROR EPIDEMIA<br />AND PANDEMIA. WHY DIDN&#39;T THEY DIRECT IN 2019 OR BEFORE ?? THEY HAVE BEEN COOKED<br />BY BIRDS, PIGS, COMES \u2026\u2026 .. AND THE NOW CONCLUDED IT IS TIME TO INCREASE THE<br />FIRE UNDER THE FROG.<br /><br /><br /><br />The reason or reasons are more FALL OF THE<br />PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THE THREATENING BREAK OF THE BANK. BECAUSE THEY<br />MAKE A CHOSE THAT I CAN MAKE THIS THING BECAUSE THEY CAN READ. So-THIS IS WHAT<br />HAPPENS TO THE REAL LIFE OF CORONA AND MAN IS NORMAL, NOTHING IS EXCELLENT. EVERY<br />YEAR, BY DATA OF VIRUSOLOGICAL CENTER IN THE WORLD OF 1000 HUNDRED SICKNESS<br />SINCE ONE OF ITS COMPLICATIONS, NOT OF ITS COMPLICATIONS THAT MEDICINE HAS NOT<br />PREVENTED. And that is it.<br /><br /><br /><br />This year, mortality will be 1 ppm. But when this<br />is presented with 3 press conferences a day, as on 600 patients, a third died\u2026.<br />then it is the production of fear in which people do not know how to calculate<br />the percentages and ask for a COMPARATION WITH THE PREVIOUS YEARS. They&#39;re<br />lying to you that these years, CORONA became a SARS COVID 19 and went on a<br />deadly march on a human race. NO. FALSE DEATH EPIDEMIA AND PANDEMIA IN THE<br />WORLD HAS AN IDENTICAL FORM OF THE POWER OF THE POWERS UNDER WHICH A SIGNATURE<br />IS STANDING. By this it is clear that this CORONA is PEDRO - DIRECTED, DIRECTED.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why do they need it?<br /><br /><br /><br />To implement the ISOLATION OF HUMANS FROM HUMANS<br />in order to break the nation-states by slamming the economy, which means the<br />destruction of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs. THE GLOBAL CAPITAL WILL<br />REMAIN BECAUSE I HAVE TO STAND HUNTING. THE FEDERAL BANK TO THIS AND THE<br />SERVICE, AND ALL OTHER BANKS, INCLUDING OUR CNB WITH THE Clown BEFORE AND THE<br />CLAUSE AFTER-SERVICE IT.<br /><br /><br /><br />The next two steps of AGENDE are: forced<br />vaccination and installation of G5 and G6 stations around cities and by<br />facilities.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why do they need forced vaccination?<br /><br /><br /><br />Because in this vaccination, as in many others,<br />there will be ALUMINUM which is a cellular receiver and amplifier of high<br />frequency electromagnetic waves. This radiation destroys the pineal gland in<br />children and destroys the human immune system and blocks cellular oxygen<br />utilization. G5 and G6 (maybe more!) Stations need to be installed. For this<br />they removed us from nature, and suddenly, as Will says in black and purple,<br />the flu is better in the stale air of the house than in the storm and the sun.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I didn&#39;t know if she was laughing or crying when I heard them. The G5<br />facilities are large around cities and they will install it in my estimation<br />ARMY and not &quot;domestic&quot; but will be some military exercises such as<br />defending Europe, so they will surround cities with G5 and G6 EM fields in<br />these exercises. In schools !! and the facilities will do so on the pretext of<br />cleaning schools or for some other reason. THAT&#39;S WHY CHILDREN AND TEACHERS ARE<br />REMOVED FROM SCHOOL. They are ALREADY STARTING in the USA and IRELAND, they<br />come as police officers in civilian clothes, or as midshipmen in a police<br />vehicle, I don&#39;t know which variant, it doesn&#39;t matter. People record them<br />because they have been persecuted by the Holy Spirit and understand what the<br />CRIMES are doing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Milanovic was not elected by the Croatian people -<br />I&#39;m sure neither was Plenkovic elected in the HDZ. They are ready for anything,<br />and WE ARE NOT. We are the ZDS, so they push us into our home, and they roll<br />with Satan&#39;s laughter as they used to make us ZDS. Croatian people, I am not<br />the only doctor who raises her voice against this bloody scam, there is<br />Sladoljev, there are American and German virologists, there are many doctors<br />who keep quiet for existence ..<br /><br /><br /><br />PLEASE READ THIS, ASK WHAT IS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT<br />YOU SEE AND HEAR WITH YOUR EYES, OTHER THAN PREVIOUS YEARS. LET THEIR STORIES,<br />REMEMBER ONE DAY AND GIVE YOUR HEALTHY REMEMBER TO ANSWER HOW MUCH IT IS ABOUT<br />YOUR SICK, MORE DEAD\u2026 Fear not rationally grounded IT&#39;S TRUE. NO TWO TRUTH.<br />THEY&#39;RE LIES I TELL YOU THE TRUTH.<br /><br /><br /><br />Wear masks in the winter when you go to places<br />with lots of people because it&#39;s part of the general health culture and a way<br />to naturally immunize yourself with flu viruses because you receive fewer<br />viruses and lymphocytes get better at dealing with them. Masks YES, but<br />CLOSING, THE PROHIBITION OF OPERATION AND MOVEMENT IS GREAT AND IS<br />UNDERSTANDING.<br /><br /><br /><br />DO YOU AGREE FOR YOUR OWN KILLING?

The syndrome\ncaused by this group of viruses is the upper and lower respiratory tract\nsyndrome, from rhinitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis to bronchitis and pneumonia.\n\n\n\nSo, this squire of viruses has been visiting the\nhuman species for about 150 years every year. The proportion of each type of\nvirus is known, so the proportion of Corona in the flu syndrome is 7-15%. It is\nno different from other influenza viruses, it does not like the nasal mucosa,\nso it attacks the pharynx, throat and bronchi more. Flu complications are not a\nmatter of the \"badness\" of this virus, but of the poor immune status\nof an infected person, such as chronic debilitating diseases, cancer,\ncytostatic therapy, many drugs, diabetes \u2026\u2026\n\n\n\nThere are no malicious viruses, but there are\nimmune systems that have been invaded and cannot respond to the virus and kill\nit. That is why in the winter months more deaths of the elderly and the sick\noccur in the transition to spring. This is a FORM that has been going on for\ndecades and centuries before us. The people even have their wise sayings for\nthis time of year. That Corona came in 2020 just as she had come all the\nprevious years and how she would have visited us all next years.\n\n\n\nBut this year, the world's hidden powerlords, the\ncriminals I guarantee you, have decided to bring a play with her that is not in\nthe least naive. They renamed Coron to SARS-Covid-19 BECAUSE THE UNKNOWN DEVICE\nIS UNKNOWN, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UNKNOWN. TO SAY THAT EPIDEMIA AND PANDEMIA\nINFLUENZA-PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE AFFECTED AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T IMPLEMENT THE\nPURPOSE. tied to it - THE SAME AS 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 And EVIL IN\nPOWER IN THE WORLD HAS REMOVED CORON FROM THIS GROUP OF VIRUSES, CHANGE ITS\nNAME, MAKE AN UNFINISHED TEST AND START TESTING AND PRODUCING HORROR EPIDEMIA\nAND PANDEMIA. WHY DIDN'T THEY DIRECT IN 2019 OR BEFORE ?? THEY HAVE BEEN COOKED\nBY BIRDS, PIGS, COMES \u2026\u2026 .. AND THE NOW CONCLUDED IT IS TIME TO INCREASE THE\nFIRE UNDER THE FROG.\n\n\n\nThe reason or reasons are more FALL OF THE\nPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THE THREATENING BREAK OF THE BANK. BECAUSE THEY\nMAKE A CHOSE THAT I CAN MAKE THIS THING BECAUSE THEY CAN READ. So-THIS IS WHAT\nHAPPENS TO THE REAL LIFE OF CORONA AND MAN IS NORMAL, NOTHING IS EXCELLENT. EVERY\nYEAR, BY DATA OF VIRUSOLOGICAL CENTER IN THE WORLD OF 1000 HUNDRED SICKNESS\nSINCE ONE OF ITS COMPLICATIONS, NOT OF ITS COMPLICATIONS THAT MEDICINE HAS NOT\nPREVENTED. And that is it.\n\n\n\nThis year, mortality will be 1 ppm. But when this\nis presented with 3 press conferences a day, as on 600 patients, a third died\u2026.\nthen it is the production of fear in which people do not know how to calculate\nthe percentages and ask for a COMPARATION WITH THE PREVIOUS YEARS. They're\nlying to you that these years, CORONA became a SARS COVID 19 and went on a\ndeadly march on a human race. NO. FALSE DEATH EPIDEMIA AND PANDEMIA IN THE\nWORLD HAS AN IDENTICAL FORM OF THE POWER OF THE POWERS UNDER WHICH A SIGNATURE\nIS STANDING. By this it is clear that this CORONA is PEDRO - DIRECTED, DIRECTED.\n\n\n\nWhy do they need it?\n\n\n\nTo implement the ISOLATION OF HUMANS FROM HUMANS\nin order to break the nation-states by slamming the economy, which means the\ndestruction of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs. THE GLOBAL CAPITAL WILL\nREMAIN BECAUSE I HAVE TO STAND HUNTING. THE FEDERAL BANK TO THIS AND THE\nSERVICE, AND ALL OTHER BANKS, INCLUDING OUR CNB WITH THE Clown BEFORE AND THE\nCLAUSE AFTER-SERVICE IT.\n\n\n\nThe next two steps of AGENDE are: forced\nvaccination and installation of G5 and G6 stations around cities and by\nfacilities.\n\n\n\nWhy do they need forced vaccination?\n\n\n\nBecause in this vaccination, as in many others,\nthere will be ALUMINUM which is a cellular receiver and amplifier of high\nfrequency electromagnetic waves. This radiation destroys the pineal gland in\nchildren and destroys the human immune system and blocks cellular oxygen\nutilization. G5 and G6 (maybe more!) Stations need to be installed. For this\nthey removed us from nature, and suddenly, as Will says in black and purple,\nthe flu is better in the stale air of the house than in the storm and the sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't know if she was laughing or crying when I heard them. The G5\nfacilities are large around cities and they will install it in my estimation\nARMY and not \"domestic\" but will be some military exercises such as\ndefending Europe, so they will surround cities with G5 and G6 EM fields in\nthese exercises. In schools !! and the facilities will do so on the pretext of\ncleaning schools or for some other reason. THAT'S WHY CHILDREN AND TEACHERS ARE\nREMOVED FROM SCHOOL. They are ALREADY STARTING in the USA and IRELAND, they\ncome as police officers in civilian clothes, or as midshipmen in a police\nvehicle, I don't know which variant, it doesn't matter. People record them\nbecause they have been persecuted by the Holy Spirit and understand what the\nCRIMES are doing.\n\n\n\nMilanovic was not elected by the Croatian people -\nI'm sure neither was Plenkovic elected in the HDZ. They are ready for anything,\nand WE ARE NOT. We are the ZDS, so they push us into our home, and they roll\nwith Satan's laughter as they used to make us ZDS. Croatian people, I am not\nthe only doctor who raises her voice against this bloody scam, there is\nSladoljev, there are American and German virologists, there are many doctors\nwho keep quiet for existence ..\n\n\n\nPLEASE READ THIS, ASK WHAT IS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT\nYOU SEE AND HEAR WITH YOUR EYES, OTHER THAN PREVIOUS YEARS. LET THEIR STORIES,\nREMEMBER ONE DAY AND GIVE YOUR HEALTHY REMEMBER TO ANSWER HOW MUCH IT IS ABOUT\nYOUR SICK, MORE DEAD\u2026 Fear not rationally grounded IT'S TRUE. NO TWO TRUTH.\nTHEY'RE LIES I TELL YOU THE TRUTH.\n\n\n\nWear masks in the winter when you go to places\nwith lots of people because it's part of the general health culture and a way\nto naturally immunize yourself with flu viruses because you receive fewer\nviruses and lymphocytes get better at dealing with them. Masks YES, but\nCLOSING, THE PROHIBITION OF OPERATION AND MOVEMENT IS GREAT AND IS\nUNDERSTANDING.\n\n\n\nDO YOU AGREE FOR YOUR OWN KILLING? WHY - IF YOU\nKNOW GOD ?!\n\n\n\ndr.
