I don't have any memories of the accident, and its pretty unclear if it was me or the truck that run over me and my bike was to blame....but I kinda always felt some of the stupidity that resulted in the loss was mine.  I physically recovered, and after 6 months I was back at work and pretty much everything was back to normal. a few months later I mentally fell apart...I was diagnosed with PTSD. getting past the PTSD was much harder than loosing the arm.....I found telling my story helped....even though I didn't want to....at least in the beginning....
