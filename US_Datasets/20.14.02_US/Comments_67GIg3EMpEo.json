As far as asking him about it when he was alive.  It was asked about.  I remember him doing a press conference with his wife present.  So it was addressed when he was alive.  I actually think it was very brave of Gayle King to touch on that subject because the truth of the matter is is that no one will ever know and it is very common for people that have experience something like that to not testify and not want to testify about it as a victim.  It\u2019s very typical that when somebody dies every part of their life is reviewed so I think it\u2019s a shame that Gayle King is being attacked over this I think it was actually brave of her to bring it up.  Also I think it\u2019s great that he turned his life around after that and he did the right thing he could\u2019ve gone either way I think he was just young and stupid and did something dumb at the end of the day he was a serial cheater and that\u2019s another thing that is going to be a scourge on his legacy but he will be remembered for the great things that he did in sports and how he continue to better himself and do great things and inspire people.
