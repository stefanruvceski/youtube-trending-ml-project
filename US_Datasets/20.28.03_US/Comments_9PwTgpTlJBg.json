I am rather short in stature, but quite big and tall from an experience point of view. On the planet where I came from, a very much older planet than is Urantia*, we spent a lot of time and we were thoroughly educated. When the first human beings turned up on Urantia we followed what happened here and we early made up our minds to come here and spend time. <br /><br />\u201cNot as much as are the Urantian Midwayers* are we involved in the goings on of this world, so when it comes to checking with my friend (this receiver of messages), I am usually the one who can be spared to come out to this home to speak with my human. There is something of recent happenings that needs to be recorded and that can perhaps be of some use to some of this world. It appears that the Covid-19, the new coronavirus will respond to Vitamin C in heavy doses, in ridiculous doses and in enormous doses. This information comes from another group that has posted this detail and has included a message sent to this receiver. <br /><br />\u201cI urge you to go back and find this email and make it known to all lists of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PwTgpTlJBg&amp;t=11m11s\">11:11</a>, all languages, and ensure that those who are interested can purchase a supply of the Vitamin C to ward off the first sniffles, the first feelings of tiredness, whatever symptoms come to the fore that may make you think that you have \u2018connected with\u2019 Covid-19. Send it to the lists and make it urgent because your midway brothers have seen some good results of the vitamin C. This is Midwayer Mathew, pleased to be with you, saying good night.\u201d <br /><br />George: \u201cThank you, Mathew. If you think . . . That email below.\u201d <br /><br />Lets see if this communication gets taken down. It is a direct quote from a news release out of China:<br /><br />Shanghai Government Officially Recommends Vitamin C for COVID-19<br /><br />Written by Andrew W. Saul<br /><br />(OMNS Mar 3, 2020) The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. (1) Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.<br /><br />These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV. (Added by GJC: 4 to 16 times max daily dosage but see below re intravenous vs oral) This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C\u2019s effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, \u201cIntravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.\u201d<br /><br />Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.<br /><br />Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.<br /><br />An official statement from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University Second Hospital (2) reads:<br /><br />\u201cOn the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . High-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[Early application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . High-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).\u201d<br /><br />\u00a9 The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PwTgpTlJBg&amp;t=11m11s\">11:11</a> Progress Group. <br />You lit a Flame, and it will become a Raging Fire \u2014 ABC-22.<br /><a href=\"http://www.1111akashicconstruct.com/\">www.1111AkashicConstruct.com</a> <br /><a href=\"http://www.1111angels.net/\">www.1111Angels.net</a><br /><br />*  The Midway Creatures: Paper 77, The Urantia Book<br /><a href=\"https://truthbook.com/urantia-book/paper-77-the-midway-creatures\">https://truthbook.com/urantia-book/paper-77-the-midway-creatures</a><br /><br /><i>_______________________________</i><br /><br />So folks, <br />get some Vitamin C T/R, like we\u2019ve been saying from the start!!!<br />\u2013\u2013 the best available as it has the highest blood level retention rate.

I am rather short in stature, but quite big and tall from an experience point of view. On the planet where I came from, a very much older planet than is Urantia*, we spent a lot of time and we were thoroughly educated. When the first human beings turned up on Urantia we followed what happened here and we early made up our minds to come here and spend time. \n\n\u201cNot as much as are the Urantian Midwayers* are we involved in the goings on of this world, so when it comes to checking with my friend (this receiver of messages), I am usually the one who can be spared to come out to this home to speak with my human. There is something of recent happenings that needs to be recorded and that can perhaps be of some use to some of this world. It appears that the Covid-19, the new coronavirus will respond to Vitamin C in heavy doses, in ridiculous doses and in enormous doses. This information comes from another group that has posted this detail and has included a message sent to this receiver. \n\n\u201cI urge you to go back and find this email and make it known to all lists of the 11:11, all languages, and ensure that those who are interested can purchase a supply of the Vitamin C to ward off the first sniffles, the first feelings of tiredness, whatever symptoms come to the fore that may make you think that you have \u2018connected with\u2019 Covid-19. Send it to the lists and make it urgent because your midway brothers have seen some good results of the vitamin C.
