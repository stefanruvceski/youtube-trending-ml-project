I know I must have been spanked too, but I don\u2019t remember it, but I do remember my dad hitting me without explaining why, him shouting and also having his palms shape on my butt or face because he used that much force when hitting me. I don\u2019t agree with that extreme type of spanking, but I\u2019ve seen kids who cry, do something rude and parents don\u2019t even notice it. I believe we learn not to touch fire because of the pain we felt when we did touch it and it hurt us. You do learn as a kid that something hot means ouch and you stay away from it. I think it depends on what the kid did, how old they are and what kind of punishment they deserve. I don\u2019t rule out spanking though.
