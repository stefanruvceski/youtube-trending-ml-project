greedy and stupid. If done right DLC is fine, it can be amazing, but 30$ for barely any content, most of it just being old Pok\u00e9mon being brought back, that&#39;s not worth 20 let alone 30$. Shovel Knight one of the best games of last decade, what made it better was free DLC, as long as you had the original game 1st back when it came out you got 3 campaigns aside from the base game, 3 unique play styles, they were through the same levels and world, but were crafted and altered to fit the new characters making them fresh and new, they were just as long if not longer, and just as fun if not way more fun than the original. Gender swap and a new battle mode in the style of smash bros also free, and even if you missed out on that deal getting the game now it&#39;s still what 15-20$ more for 4 times the content? Shantae did exactly the same with it&#39;s last game, it provided more than 5 times the gameplay with new characters or alterations that made the play through unique only for 10$ more, base game is 20, ultimate is 30$. the equivalent price range for this Pok\u00e9mon DLC is as much as Pok\u00e9mon Silver, Gold, and Crystal were back in the day, games that were twice the size of the 1st generation, provided twice as much content, and for the same price of 30$ as the 1st generation games. <br /><br />This is robbery, 30$ is too much for this stuff on a game nobody like, even if it sold well doesn&#39;t mean people like it, and you expect us to buy it because you are working off our crutch of we gotta catch em all because you created that concept for the games back in the beginning. People were complaining about dex cuts and bad graphics back when only the 1st trailer dropped, that was nothing compared to this, I was fine with no national dex, I don&#39;t use the old Pok\u00e9mon anyways, if I want to I can go back and play the games they came from. Most of the complainers were people that did competitive, but Pok\u00e9mon isn&#39;t a competitive game, it never has been, but even the company now thinks we suddenly need to make it competitive. Pok\u00e9mon while it has competition has never been about that, the core premise is about adventure and collecting, like the creator did when he was a child collecting bugs, it&#39;s always been about that. With Sword and Shield you ruined that, heck you even butchered the story, who the hell saves the villain reveal till right before the credits role? That&#39;s what you did, you never do that in any form of entertainment that&#39;s God awful, there was no build up, there was no story development, yes we knew who the villains were be because it&#39;s predictable but there were no hints to it until right before the Champion battle. After this game&#39;s equivalent to elite 4, and right before the champion battle, the champion signifies the end of the game, it&#39;s the ultimate goal and the strongest trainer, but you interrupted that, you pulled us out of the moment and force us to go do this task. At that point it&#39;s just a chore that we groan about because we don&#39;t want to do that, we were busy and in the middle of another thing, that&#39;s terrible story writing. <br /><br />What was the point of that rant, because I enjoyed the game up until that point, everyone was judging it on &quot;bad graphics&quot; and the lack of a national dex, those were menial arguments, judgement people made and refused to buy the game for because of that despite not experiencing the actual game itself. What I did was made an actual reason for why this game is bad, there are many other reasons, but that was my biggest. Four of my others would be lack of a GTS, raid battles, the pandering to gen 1 AGAIN for the 7th year in a row, and how you handled the legendary. The cpus suck for raid battles, and I hate playing stuff with other people, it&#39;s impossible to fight a 5 star raid battle on your own without real humans that have brains. I love Charizard, but holy crap KNOCK OFF THE GEN 1 PANDERING you&#39;re making me hate my favorite Pok\u00e9mon because he has too many forms and is getting too much pandering, what about Typhlosion, 20th anniversary to gen 2, you&#39;ve done absolutely nothing with those mon since the remakes what 10 years ago? Re release of the originals was cool, but come on, same with gens 4 and 5. Making the 3rd legendary a guaranteed catch and you catch it in the main game (again after interrupting the story that was already in progress), but the box legendaries are post game, why not make all legendaries post game? <br /><br />You are ruining my childhood, a game series I&#39;ve stuck with since the very beginning, one after another with the screw ups, all I have to say is there better be no sequel game to Sword and Shield, or a cannon version, because then people will truly riot, a 60$ Pok\u00e9mon game when they&#39;ve only ever been 30-40, plus 30 DLC, and another 60$ game that has little to no additions, that would be awful.", "textOriginal": "Gotta catch em all, more like gotta buy em all, why does everyone think they need to jump on the DLC train, it's greedy and stupid.

I love Charizard, but holy crap KNOCK OFF THE GEN 1 PANDERING you're making me hate my favorite Pok\u00e9mon because he has too many forms and is getting too much pandering, what about Typhlosion, 20th anniversary to gen 2, you've done absolutely nothing with those mon since the remakes what 10 years ago? Re release of the originals was cool, but come on, same with gens 4 and 5. Making the 3rd legendary a guaranteed catch and you catch it in the main game (again after interrupting the story that was already in progress), but the box legendaries are post game, why not make all legendaries post game? \n\nYou are ruining my childhood, a game series I've stuck with since the very beginning, one after another with the screw ups, all I have to say is there better be no sequel game to Sword and Shield, or a cannon version, because then people will truly riot, a 60$ Pok\u00e9mon game when they've only ever been 30-40, plus 30 DLC, and another 60$ game that has little to no additions, that would be awful.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 2, "publishedAt": "2020-01-10T22:01:26.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-10T22:01:26.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/xv7K7F4TuYEI9qnsn6Djd7Pm0-U\"", "id": "UgyMb4UhuMzPsKXLxdx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "bRUWgM31BRQ", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/LZiXDT6_VE7VzNwO2azCCg136sM\"", "id": "UgyMb4UhuMzPsKXLxdx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Luis Pecho Garcia", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-T4zUg-JR7V52ZwIHohXF-e3Y0lOqdgRPOKw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxj3HV2zdBwiuqcmhrqZf5Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxj3HV2zdBwiuqcmhrqZf5Q"}, "videoId": "bRUWgM31BRQ", "textDisplay": "6146 3265 1577", "textOriginal": "6146 3265 1577", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-10T22:01:01.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-10T22:01:01.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/hNd6Uo2Aug_hydZVMLo1ygRO9co\"", "id": "UgzbSElXDY3W53xWsbZ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "bRUWgM31BRQ", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/r2M6gyrf6nXqc6asyC5Q_2clgm8\"", "id": "UgzbSElXDY3W53xWsbZ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Diabolus Rex The Vyond YouTuber Fan 2019", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79Vj6TB5DtBRj1D80_qwoQD9ehBCIGHahalwA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLXg5cKIdebG31R3GxPU7A", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJLXg5cKIdebG31R3GxPU7A"}, "videoId": "bRUWgM31BRQ", "textDisplay": "My doggo Lycanroc returns!
