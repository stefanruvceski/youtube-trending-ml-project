This is just a theory <br /><br />Chris Benoit &quot;could have&quot; been framed and murdered. Look at the evidence: 01) Chavo Guerrero had told WWE magazine that he talked to Chris for while on Friday night on his house phone. About 45 minutes into the conversation, Chris told him that there was somebody knocking @ his door &amp; he was going to see who it was. Shortly after Chris answered the door, there was a \u201cscuffle\u201d &amp; then his house phone line went dead. Chris could only be reached on his cell phone about 3 hours later. This is very significant. This explains why there was no forced entry. Chris let the killer or killers in. 02) After Chavo reached Chris on his cell phone, he sounded very odd, groggy &amp; tired. He also said that Chris told him \u201cI Love You Chavo\u201d which sounded forced. The WWE also said that when Chris called in &amp; told them that Nancy &amp; Daniel were sick, he didn&#39;t sound like himself. He sounded groggy. Chris then said \u201cI Love You\u201d which they say was out of context, because he usually didn\u2019t say this. 03) Chris Benoit\u2019s cell phone is missing. The police can&#39;t find it, or the needles they say Chris used to inject himself with steroids shortly before he died. The police have turned his cell phone off. 04) Chris wasn&#39;t hanging from the weight machine, he was laying on the floor underneath the machine. Another officer said that Benoit was \u201cslumped\u201d against the weight machine. 05) There was a white cloth wrapped around Chris\u2019 neck. If he was so suicidal why would he care if his neck was bruised? 06) The medical examiner says that Benoit died on Saturday. The text messages were sent on Sunday. Chris was already dead, so who sent the text messages? It&#39;s noted that nobody talked to Chris on Sunday. 07) The steroids found in Chris\u2019 house weren&#39;t in his body. 08) If Chris\u2019 had murdered his family then why did he need to text people? Think about it. Everybody was dead. Nobody would hear him talking so why text? Calling would have been easier. (it&#39;s believed the killer texted Benoit\u2019s address to get somebody to come to the house, to find the bodies) 09) Chris sent Chavo a text message telling him his address. Why would he do this? Chavo already knew were Chris lived. He spent the previous weekend with him. 10) Chris\u2019 body was badly de-composed, about the same as Nancy\u2019s. This shows he died sooner than Sunday. 11) Why would he tie up Nancy to kill her? He was a big guy. He could have just hit her 1 good time &amp; she would&#39;ve been out. 12) The world press reported the manner of the deaths wrong. They said that Daniel was shot in his head &amp; Nancy was shot in her chest. 13) Chavo said that the Chris Benoit seemed \u201cworried\u201d about something, but he wouldn&#39;t open up &amp; tell him why he was worried. 14) There was no Bible besides Chris\u2019 body. Why would he place a bible beside Nancy &amp; Daniel but not place one beside his own, if he knew he was about to take his own life? 15) There were 10 empty beer cans &amp; an empty bottle wine besides Chris\u2019 body. He tested negative for alcohol. 16) The toxicology confirmed that Benoit had Hydrocodone (a pain killer) &amp; Xanex (an anti-anxiety drug) in his system. These 2 drugs combined would sedate Chris &amp; make him very sleepy. So he couldn&#39;t fight back. 17) The police originally said that Daniel died on Friday, because his body was badly de-composing. This supports beliefs that all 3 died on Friday night. The police changed the manner of Daniel\u2019s death 3 times. 1st he died from a garbage bag, 2nd he died from a choke hold, 3rd he was smothered by a pillow. Why would they keep changing? 18) The police kept changing the location of where Nancy\u2019s body was found. 1st she was found in the downstairs family room. 2nd she was found in the upstairs bedroom. 3rd she was found in the house office. 19) Chris\u2019 father said that he called on Father\u2019s Day &amp; told him that he wished he could spend more time with his family, but he had to work. 1 of Nancy\u2019s friend says that Nancy loved Chris &amp; she had no plans to leave him. 20) Retired Wrestler Bam Bam Bigalow died January 19th 2007. Sherry Martel died June 15th 2007. The Benoit family died June 22nd 2007. Since this family died, 2 other wrestlers have died. (Brian Adams &amp; Johnny Crush in July &amp; August 2007) Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero &amp; Brian Pillman all died the night before they were set to win title belts. Sherry Martel\u2019s death seems even more suspicious; she had ties to Nancy Benoit\u2019s ex-husband Kevin Sullivan. The circumstances surrounding her death haven&#39;t been released. 21) Sullivan told Benoit that he&#39;d kill him. Kevin&#39;s currently a high ranking member of a satanic cult. Kevin was also on the WWE Board of Directors. He also had motive to kill Daniel Benoit, because he was Chris &amp; Nancy\u2019s offspring. Retired wrestler &quot;American Dream&quot; Dusty Rhodes said that \u201che danced with the devil\u201d when working with Sullivan, who was known as being cold-hearted &amp; conniving. The Benoit family was murdered on the 10-year anniversary of Nancy\u2019s divorce from Kevin. 22) Nancy Benoit\u2019s death was posted on the internet, 14 hours before her body was found. 23) Weeks before he died, Chris Benoit\u2019s colleagues said that Chris began taking alternate routes to &amp; from work &amp; back to his house. The Benoits believed that somebody was following them. Chris\u2019 friends dismissed his worries as paranoia. Huge Respect to Chris Jericho and Chavo Guerrero for helping out David Beniot. Maybe one fine day he could be a great wrestler like his father.<br /><br /><br /><br />One thing I really wish they would&#39;ve addressed is Bif Wellington.<br /><br />It\u2019s certainly an eerie coincidence that two members of the same family, in the same profession, and former tag team partners, would die on the same day, thousands of miles apart.<br /><br />Also Arn Anderson&#39;s creepy cryptic promo ripping Chris and Nancy for Kevin Sullivan was also eerie as hell.<br /><br />(More than likely his brain was mush from the concussions and he went off the deep end. Because it would be hard as hell to stage 3 murders)  but it is possible and interesting<br /><br /> But coincidentally you can&#39;t lie a lot of this case is weird", "textOriginal": "Just stating I do think Chris Benoit did it but there is so much weird shit about this.

Sherry Martel died June 15th 2007. The Benoit family died June 22nd 2007. Since this family died, 2 other wrestlers have died. (Brian Adams & Johnny Crush in July & August 2007) Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero & Brian Pillman all died the night before they were set to win title belts. Sherry Martel\u2019s death seems even more suspicious; she had ties to Nancy Benoit\u2019s ex-husband Kevin Sullivan. The circumstances surrounding her death haven't been released. 21) Sullivan told Benoit that he'd kill him. Kevin's currently a high ranking member of a satanic cult. Kevin was also on the WWE Board of Directors. He also had motive to kill Daniel Benoit, because he was Chris & Nancy\u2019s offspring. Retired wrestler \"American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes said that \u201che danced with the devil\u201d when working with Sullivan, who was known as being cold-hearted & conniving. The Benoit family was murdered on the 10-year anniversary of Nancy\u2019s divorce from Kevin. 22) Nancy Benoit\u2019s death was posted on the internet, 14 hours before her body was found. 23) Weeks before he died, Chris Benoit\u2019s colleagues said that Chris began taking alternate routes to & from work & back to his house. The Benoits believed that somebody was following them. Chris\u2019 friends dismissed his worries as paranoia. Huge Respect to Chris Jericho and Chavo Guerrero for helping out David Beniot. Maybe one fine day he could be a great wrestler like his father.\n\n\n\nOne thing I really wish they would've addressed is Bif Wellington.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly an eerie coincidence that two members of the same family, in the same profession, and former tag team partners, would die on the same day, thousands of miles apart.\n\nAlso Arn Anderson's creepy cryptic promo ripping Chris and Nancy for Kevin Sullivan was also eerie as hell.\n\n(More than likely his brain was mush from the concussions and he went off the deep end. Because it would be hard as hell to stage 3 murders)  but it is possible and interesting\n\n But coincidentally you can't lie a lot of this case is weird", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-26T04:48:16.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-26T04:48:16.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"ksCrgYQhtFrXgbHAhi9Fo5t0C2I/IeJL8kHiUsHhDTUzHktLcOdSJlE\"", "id": "UgxbmjA4l6iHd87REUh4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "XkUsAztC4Xc", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"ksCrgYQhtFrXgbHAhi9Fo5t0C2I/-nw1sva2ywfnfCV3VPt-05jge_E\"", "id": "UgxbmjA4l6iHd87REUh4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "MrJordanhead19", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJy_sYofzshZCp-zBwan6un6ewVQKGy3_lXhbQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQpcOG3io2cefXSbmkK1CTQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQpcOG3io2cefXSbmkK1CTQ"}, "videoId": "XkUsAztC4Xc", "textDisplay": "Was supposed to go to the show the canceled in corpus before they knew he the details", "textOriginal": "Was supposed to go to the show the canceled in corpus before they knew he the details", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-26T04:43:13.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-26T04:43:13.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"ksCrgYQhtFrXgbHAhi9Fo5t0C2I/QKsqmBLBQ0xDu8jpmrIPsDS0Jvo\"", "id": "Ugy9U1vItGGz_XUlB2d4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "XkUsAztC4Xc", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"ksCrgYQhtFrXgbHAhi9Fo5t0C2I/frw3wWhO9i64EO74iPRcAniktSM\"", "id": "Ugy9U1vItGGz_XUlB2d4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Ryon L", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxg5w59U97NquTm08q7PdZDF4qZrCJM7FdZsA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3gM6qw7LjFEccviIk1-LsQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3gM6qw7LjFEccviIk1-LsQ"}, "videoId": "XkUsAztC4Xc", "textDisplay": "\u201cGreat.\u201d- Dean Malenko winning the lottery", "textOriginal": "\u201cGreat.\u201d- Dean Malenko winning the lottery", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-03-26T04:38:10.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-03-26T04:38:10.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"ksCrgYQhtFrXgbHAhi9Fo5t0C2I/fAa9zsnUZARCP6JZtxe-PSFo6SM\"", "id": "UgwooUqJykvXUvazL7F4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "XkUsAztC4Xc", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"ksCrgYQhtFrXgbHAhi9Fo5t0C2I/T9hpVxOPLVDQZgeRESm7bKmXkN8\"", "id": "UgwooUqJykvXUvazL7F4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Mark Curtis", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzRuLeKf5D_5GPD8rRSXWS8cE-Vcsp5eFj1Pg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Uz99gszzmLYT-_lOGnUsQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5Uz99gszzmLYT-_lOGnUsQ"}, "videoId": "XkUsAztC4Xc", "textDisplay": "Dean Malenko is very shaky, and JR sounds just as fake and insincere as ever.
