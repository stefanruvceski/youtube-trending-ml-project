When Han Solo comes back and Kylo Ren is sorry was so powerfully executed. And when Chewie roared when Leia died was also a feelsmoment. I liked the training montage to right the Mary Sue thing and Luke getting his real jedi moment Mark Hamill always rightfully complained about was also much appreciated. seeing a young Luke and Leia was cool and Ian Mcdiarmid as the emperor was awesome. Should have been Snoke or Plagieus I agree but blame Rian Fucker Johnson. Ian Mcdiarmid is a great actor and seeing him as the Emperor was redeeming. Also bye bye bitch Hux.

No matter what happened, they should have had 1 vision for the trilogy. Instead, they did each movie in a vacuum. And that is the greatest failure of Disney Star Wars. As much as I hate the zombifying of nostalgic franchises for the creatively bankrupt studios to leech off, it could have worked. People liked The Force Awakens, even if it wasn't \"special\". Disney has no one to blame but Kathleen Kennedy, for bungling the execution. Rian was the bad actor who destroyed, not Star Wars, but Disney Star Wars.
