It\u2019s just too much for one movie that doesn\u2019t really need to exist since TLJ kinda gave a definitive ending. They could\u2019ve just made an episode 9, 10, and 11 that was a lot of the plot of this movie, but with more foreshadowing, showing the First Order taking more control over the galaxy, and showing the Resistance bringing hope to people so that the ending where a million ships come to help defeat the Final Order feels justified and not totally disjointed from the ending of TLJ. \n\nHonestly I kinda just like to pretend this movie doesn\u2019t exist, since TFA and TLJ have their own self-contained story, villains, and character arcs, which I quite like. I understand why people don\u2019t like them, but I do like them quite a lot, particularly the Last Jedi.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-26T19:02:14.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-26T19:02:14.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/NWGacV4iu0yIuMidEEljhfSKKbc\"", "id": "UgzE8DvJLIMBZJBv4694AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "XquCCHJuZDE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/ml6vjVp4QvyU6U9MMBplgVKak5o\"", "id": "UgzE8DvJLIMBZJBv4694AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Robert Zenni", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78SJ7tVrfw2fkZtbACqpn5_q1lTWnYWLh__Ig=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuLVO5mtN1hFZrED_AwDKgA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuLVO5mtN1hFZrED_AwDKgA"}, "videoId": "XquCCHJuZDE", "textDisplay": "It\u2019s okay, better then episode 1,2,3", "textOriginal": "It\u2019s okay, better then episode 1,2,3", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-26T18:59:27.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-26T18:59:27.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/FUzjz27GQ8n9FELA6DF741EAmsE\"", "id": "Ugw3UvgQEzcVV4JJl1d4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "XquCCHJuZDE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/ufBi8WuKMPvkyeeCMFI6diWLoRE\"", "id": "Ugw3UvgQEzcVV4JJl1d4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Krazer", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79iY7s2FptnsRuRtpzhwuOFDZa7Lf92XXxq-g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxTKW9JSJD2P5BQ07HVS3yg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxTKW9JSJD2P5BQ07HVS3yg"}, "videoId": "XquCCHJuZDE", "textDisplay": "Personally I found the movie very Meh.

Your criticism used to have more layers than that. I really liked your first two reviews on this trilogies, because you held the fanbase accountable, you weren&#39;t obsessed with your own viewpoints, you weren&#39;t afraid to swim against the loud obnoxious internet mainstream and you talked about more aspects of film making than just some creative decisions. That was very refreshing to watch, especially after TLJ came out and the Star Wars community on the internet turned into the usual hellscape as it always does when a new movie comes out. This time it just feels like part of the noise. I mean, i really didn&#39;t like Rise of Skywalker either and agree with you on some things, but I find it disappointing (and also very ironic) that in order to make this final one, you had to turn a 180\u00b0 on what you said before, only to boil it down to just bitterness. So after all, your grand result is: Disney sucks? That&#39;s it? &quot;This sucks! That sucks! I won&#39;t even bother with arguments or what transpired behind the scenes! Everything just sucks! Muh, Disney kills Star Wars.&quot; In your last video you applauded Disney for giving Rian Johnson so much creative freedom. Here you claim Disney is running everything into the ground. Sure, opinions change, but that&#39;s kind of a weird and drastic change.<br />You kinda saved it with your final sentence, but still... I thought you would have a lot more to say here.

Think about Rian Johnson what you want, but he worked closely with the story group (as shown in TLJ BTS material), he had a vision and he stood by it. I would call this artistic integrity. Unfortunately, J.J. Abrams seemed to have lacked that. TROS clearly cared more about appeasing this dumb backlash more than telling a good story. And I thought this is what you would talk about, following up on your criticism towards the fanbase from your last two videos. That this one is kinda on us.
