I have some questions and I request you to make a video on only the menstrual periods we have and some facts that we common people might not know. I am asking you these questions because even though nowadays everyone is quite open about these I never got proper answers to my question and am not being taken to doctor and also trusting google is dangerous. So my questions are:-\r<br />1. Why do the we have cramps, headache, acne, etc. during the period?\r<br />2. I recently had very severe breast pain, I asked my mom and she said it happens during the periods. Why? (Google said I had breast cancer, it freaked me out.) \r<br />3. Why do some girls like me have extremely severe period cramps and why do some girls don&#39;t have it at all?\r<br />4. My periods are extremely irregular (my periods started 3 years ago), but some of my friends already have regular periods. Why does it differ in everyone?\r<br />5. Should I consult a doctor because once I didn&#39;t had my period for 3 months and then I had my period 3 times in a single month. And I had drips of blood for the whole last month(I had period the whole last month) and now this month my period started properly. Is it normal?\r<br />6. Pads v/s Tampons v/s Menstrual cup? Which is the best? (I am a teenager so I obviously use a pad, but still..)\r<br />7. What is Birth control?\r<br />8. How to keep personal hygiene during the periods?\r<br />9. Why do we have a discharge when we are not on our periods?\r<br />10. Not related to periods: Please give tips to study and remember a lot information. I am an audio and visual learner but i am in school so i can&#39;t record what all is taught in school. So pls suggest what should I do. Also I am a night person. What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a day person or a night person.\r<br />I hope you will read my comment and answer my questions. It took me half an hour to write this. Hope you won&#39;t disappoint me. And also anyone who reads my comment pls do reply to it. Love your channel and pls do keep making such entertaining and educational videos.
