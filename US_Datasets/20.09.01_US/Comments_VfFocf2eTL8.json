A girl with respect who actually loves the guy would&#39;ve done this off screen somewhere else not for the whole world to see, which really makes me figure out how fake this show is, and what&#39;s worse is that Peter actually chose many girls who seem like amazing wife material, like the girls he chose actually don&#39;t seem too bad and they deserve more than this, and tbh they should just leave if Hannah is coming on the season cause that&#39;s just some B.S. right there. Hannah wasted her whole entire season by just kissing guys all day like I don&#39;t even think she was really looking for a husband or she just wasn&#39;t ready but just thought she was, and what pisses me off more is that she goes to the girls group date and says the windmill story, to me it seemed like she was trying to rub it in the girls faces more than  being genuine, and Peter should&#39;ve talked to the girls about this whole Hannah thing instead of just inviting her, and think about this, if he actually truly loved Hannah he would have not invited her because he knows dang well if he invites her she&#39;s  going to get a lot of backlash from the girls, who might hurt her feelings, and if someone loves someone they would make sure to not hurt the person no matter what.

I think they both still love each other. Just look at how emotional they both are in this moment. The show may have set this up for ratings, but I only think they included this in the show because they both still had feelings. I watched all of Colton and Hannah\u2019s season, and I truly think Hannah was confused when it came to her final 3. Colton was dead set that he wanted Cassie and wasn\u2019t willing to settle. Hannah, you could see, was in distress and emotional on the day of her final rose ceremony, because she was conflicted and didn\u2019t want to let anyone go. Peter was the only guy she slept with, and maybe she felt they lacked a true connection for that. And you could tell she only picked Jed because she was comfortable, they didn\u2019t have a pure and genuine connection like she did with both Tyler and Peter. However, I feel her comfort with Jed left her feeling scared and uneasy about starting a relationship with Peter and Tyler. After picking Jed and finding out that he practically cheated on her and his girlfriend back home, she realized she messed up. I truly think she thought she was in love with Jed, when all along she was truly in love with Tyler and Peter and didn\u2019t know what her heart wanted. The girl is allowed to be confused or second guess a decision she made. She felt the pressure of the show. She saw Peter was the next Bachelor and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t reach out to Peter knowing he was keeping his options open while Tyler was reaching out. But, you could tell there were feelings on both Peter and Hannah\u2019s end at the finale live show. She couldn\u2019t have expected Peter to make the effort to reach out to her, when she slept with him the night before, made him believe he was the one, and then send him home. She ended things with him. I understand both point of views. Hannah picked Jed, then asked Tyler out, and then when that didn\u2019t seem to work out, she suddenly wants Peter back. And Peter deserves this opportunity to find love and not be someone\u2019s third choice. But I don\u2019t think that is what he is to her. I think she thought she was over him, or was trying to move forward knowing he was the Bachelor, but then seeing him as the Bachelor and reuniting with him brought back nostalgia and old memories and feelings. They both truly aren\u2019t over each other even though they thought they were. However, it isn\u2019t fair to the whole house of women who are waiting to find their potential husband, but let\u2019s not act like we haven\u2019t once thought we were over someone before until something triggers us and brings those old feelings back. Peter and Hannah probably haven\u2019t spoken in months until the show started filming and seeing each other triggered something. My guess is that Peter goes back to the house and resumes with dating and gives it a fair shot, while Hannah goes home because she was in DWTS when this was filming. Once Peter gets to his final 2 girls, he feels conflicted because he doesn\u2019t feel a strong connection with either of them and knows he still feels for Hannah. He goes home to get advice from his parents and when they see that he isn\u2019t happy, and that Hannah is who makes him happy, they tell him to go get her. That\u2019s why his mom was crying, (because she wouldn\u2019t be crying had it not been an emotional discussion), and that\u2019s when she says \u201cbring her home to us.\u201d They loved Hannah on Peter\u2019s hometown visit.
