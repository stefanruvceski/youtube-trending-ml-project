It would be one thing if he just expressed how he disagrees with the decisions you make in life, but the fact that he's choosing a religion over a relationship with you ENTIRELY is not okay. You're an adult and can make your own choices whether he agrees with them or not & he needs to respect that. A Christian friend of mine made the same choice about going to her sister's gay wedding for basically the same reasons and I never agreed with her then either. I would never encourage you to give up on your relationship with your dad, but being that he's the parent, it's his responsibility to make things right at this point and not yours. It may be, based on what you've already said, that the best thing is to let him go and to let it be. I will make sure to keep your family in my prayers Hannah.
