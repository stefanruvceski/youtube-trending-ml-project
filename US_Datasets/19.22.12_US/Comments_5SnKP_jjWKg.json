Big shame I must say, for many have come to testify of wrongdoing by the president \"under oath\" and in the full glare of Cameras and yet some feel we the onlookers are morons!", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-20T14:06:48.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-20T14:06:48.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/QOcC_1RU5doVfCb6LN2_CzQVoZg\"", "id": "UgyJx0Gyi-yaPUSloHt4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/bQyXpwjM8oMWM8eh4nNKSZGKrpE\"", "id": "UgyJx0Gyi-yaPUSloHt4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Sam Lim", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-W6pedkwONpVkUepAT-kGqry1VkhpEzYFEsA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu504n6pYTJBPnbHKFyV_GA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCu504n6pYTJBPnbHKFyV_GA"}, "videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "textDisplay": "TRAITOR LAWLESS TRUMP IS NO DOUBT AN ASSET OF RUSSIA AND WORKS FOR PUTIN !<br /><br />JUST FOLLOW THE MONEY !!!!", "textOriginal": "TRAITOR LAWLESS TRUMP IS NO DOUBT AN ASSET OF RUSSIA AND WORKS FOR PUTIN !\n\nJUST FOLLOW THE MONEY !!!!", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-20T14:04:33.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-20T14:04:33.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/EeKF3RVtB-Y6put0kW2ZN5Uzye0\"", "id": "UgyoEnYisbfXVh_Hkj54AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/NlSOrNASAxIB35sbCHta4Ma-fwA\"", "id": "UgyoEnYisbfXVh_Hkj54AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Juan Camacho", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79-AmyEJxk1xoxgq7A7QDFt7b125q_T5APYZg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0PqFnNpP_O1JWv0RE3su-Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0PqFnNpP_O1JWv0RE3su-Q"}, "videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "textDisplay": "90% of all these politicians are a bunch of Hipocrits sucking saggy Balls....\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude1c", "textOriginal": "90% of all these politicians are a bunch of Hipocrits sucking saggy Balls....\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude1c", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-20T13:53:47.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-20T13:53:47.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/D22t4qD3QO1E-6HcO6GaLNTEFwY\"", "id": "UgwQAXn0RZLF8NpppaR4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/g2DxRHIKOOhmOy2O7Mx_l1p9ELM\"", "id": "UgwQAXn0RZLF8NpppaR4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Juan Camacho", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79-AmyEJxk1xoxgq7A7QDFt7b125q_T5APYZg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0PqFnNpP_O1JWv0RE3su-Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0PqFnNpP_O1JWv0RE3su-Q"}, "videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "textDisplay": "With TRUMP Impeached my Family is going to have the best<br />Christmas Ever...<br />Trump Family,, have a great Christmas \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75.....", "textOriginal": "With TRUMP Impeached my Family is going to have the best\nChristmas Ever...\nTrump Family,, have a great Christmas \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75.....", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-20T13:51:00.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-20T13:51:00.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/uvFKOcvvp34nlxmiEWvV0655ICA\"", "id": "Ugxe14gDNziYVRGwBEx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/xxe4hJzizfNllvPxU6UbWxa7urQ\"", "id": "Ugxe14gDNziYVRGwBEx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Juan Camacho", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79-AmyEJxk1xoxgq7A7QDFt7b125q_T5APYZg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0PqFnNpP_O1JWv0RE3su-Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0PqFnNpP_O1JWv0RE3su-Q"}, "videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "textDisplay": "Clown TRUMP should&#39;ve been imprached cc since he started cus he is a Fuck up from the beginning...

The implications is that when the President (or other impeachable official) has committed an impeachable offense, the Members of the House, bound by the oaths they take to uphold the Constitution, are under a particular obligation to deal with the miscreant&#39;s offenses, irrespective of whether their bill of impeachment may or may not lead to a conviction in the Senate. Simply disliking the President is not a impeachable offence, but then again under the miscreant Democrats whom have become rabid like a dog with rabies, anything seem to goes which offends their delicate feelings of a bully whom demands the rules, which removes all due process for the accused. The Democrats will play every dirty trick in the book and more to buy time before the election. A Trump acquittal in the Senate trail will heavily impact the survival of the Democrat Party in the next election, because President Trump is winning on so many political issues that matter to the people.. The Democrats funding is also drying up and they know they are in trouble as election season cycle is upon us.. <br /><br />The bigger reason why the miscreant&#39;s Democrats are doing this is because in <a href=\"http://pacer.gov/\">pacer.gov</a> (federal Courts Website) the high number of Criminal cases that in in sealed status is staggeringly high. Since November 2017, there is over 130,000 sealed indictments across the US. It is normally barely above 1000 per year. Let that profound information sink in and to why the Democrats are panicking. The only way for them to stop this is to remove the President and to fire the DOJ officials engaging in criminal cases against them and also the heads of the Military tribunals.. <br />There is unknown number of Military Tribunals ongoing and Guantanamo and other Military Prisons has been massively updated to allow for elderly prisoners and expanded numbers to be held in high secure prison. This indicates the Military Tribunals are going to be substantial. The US is still in a State of War since 911 (Sept 2001) on war (US longest war) against terror (Terrorists), so Military Tribunals can try any Citizen whom is aiding and abetting the enemy of the US State in times of war. Democrats seems to be in favor of Terrorists whom are acting against the US. Go back to Justice Kavanaugh Hearing for the Supreme Court on questionings about Body of &quot;Law of War&quot; and Military tribunals. <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4747307/user-clip-sen-graham-asks-military-tribunals\">https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4747307/user-clip-sen-graham-asks-military-tribunals</a> <br />I deeply suspect that Senator John McCain was executed in a Military Tribunal and was given the General Rommel option of suicide, it explains the bizarre of the McCain Family and of Governor Kasich (whom is against the death Penalty) slip of the tongue of &quot;Put to Death&quot; about John McCain. Governors are legally informed when the Military executes a convicted person. &quot;put to death&quot; is not a normal phrase to say when someone dies of cancer or illness or just simply dies of any reason other than violent killing.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S53-2LYUefQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S53-2LYUefQ</a> Why do I think McCain was a traitor of the US.

Only The Senate can remove the President from office by 2/3 majority only after the Trail of Articles of Impeachment is successful and another resolution of removal of office begins. There is nothing the House can do. They are failing in their duty to send their manager to the Senate to start prosecution. They know their case is very weak. They know many Democrats are going to get punished in the next election, so this is beyond a &quot;hail Mary&quot; Maneuver, but it is a Pelosi Pinocchio noisy nose of &quot;Kitchen Sink Impeachment&quot; failing attempt take down coup against President Donald J Trump. P.S. President Trump wants a Trail.

A Trump acquittal in the Senate trail will heavily impact the survival of the Democrat Party in the next election, because President Trump is winning on so many political issues that matter to the people.. The Democrats funding is also drying up and they know they are in trouble as election season cycle is upon us.. \n\nThe bigger reason why the miscreant's Democrats are doing this is because in pacer.gov (federal Courts Website) the high number of Criminal cases that in in sealed status is staggeringly high. Since November 2017, there is over 130,000 sealed indictments across the US. It is normally barely above 1000 per year. Let that profound information sink in and to why the Democrats are panicking. The only way for them to stop this is to remove the President and to fire the DOJ officials engaging in criminal cases against them and also the heads of the Military tribunals.. \nThere is unknown number of Military Tribunals ongoing and Guantanamo and other Military Prisons has been massively updated to allow for elderly prisoners and expanded numbers to be held in high secure prison. This indicates the Military Tribunals are going to be substantial. The US is still in a State of War since 911 (Sept 2001) on war (US longest war) against terror (Terrorists), so Military Tribunals can try any Citizen whom is aiding and abetting the enemy of the US State in times of war. Democrats seems to be in favor of Terrorists whom are acting against the US. Go back to Justice Kavanaugh Hearing for the Supreme Court on questionings about Body of \"Law of War\" and Military tribunals. https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4747307/user-clip-sen-graham-asks-military-tribunals \nI deeply suspect that Senator John McCain was executed in a Military Tribunal and was given the General Rommel option of suicide, it explains the bizarre of the McCain Family and of Governor Kasich (whom is against the death Penalty) slip of the tongue of \"Put to Death\" about John McCain. Governors are legally informed when the Military executes a convicted person. \"put to death\" is not a normal phrase to say when someone dies of cancer or illness or just simply dies of any reason other than violent killing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S53-2LYUefQ Why do I think McCain was a traitor of the US. Look up John McCain own twitter feed on his visit to Syria with meeting and aiding terrorists (With Obama Administration blessing) , and the Leader of the Terrorist group ISIS of which President Trump executed in Syria in recent months.  https://twitter.com/senjohnmccain/status/339455679800700928?lang=fi \nLook at the man behind McCain. \nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dlg1cHGXoAIZMpY.jpg:large\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50297801\n\nLets be clear, Impeachment is not a removal of office. Only The Senate can remove the President from office by 2/3 majority only after the Trail of Articles of Impeachment is successful and another resolution of removal of office begins. There is nothing the House can do. They are failing in their duty to send their manager to the Senate to start prosecution. They know their case is very weak. They know many Democrats are going to get punished in the next election, so this is beyond a \"hail Mary\" Maneuver, but it is a Pelosi Pinocchio noisy nose of \"Kitchen Sink Impeachment\" failing attempt take down coup against President Donald J Trump. P.S. President Trump wants a Trail. He is looking forward to it. \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/nov/22/donald-trump-fox-and-friends-interview-impeachment-trial", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-20T13:29:09.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-20T13:29:09.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/l3muEsymMJROuOuTz7yai0OVUzs\"", "id": "UgyK57yQrxq5smWL51N4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/vHAwLYt2mqRkdzBItGQn_pnE21s\"", "id": "UgyK57yQrxq5smWL51N4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Pizza the Hut", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78KdFPiIEITmHwPuji9ZtWH4ntWrRO01Cd-ew=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqc09qgDSQsZNyswDs85CSQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqc09qgDSQsZNyswDs85CSQ"}, "videoId": "5SnKP_jjWKg", "textDisplay": "Guys....it\u2019s Christmas.
