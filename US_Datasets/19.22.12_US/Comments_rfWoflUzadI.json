I also wish Rey would have died after defeating Palpetine....ideally I would have liked that fight to be a little longer and more dramatic because I agree with you, she wasn\u2019t strong enough and it just didn\u2019t feel quite right how he died. That being said I don\u2019t know how they would have killed him otherwise. But I wanted Ben and Rey and Palpetine to die to show heavy loses but an overall victory for the rebels. It\u2019s the end of the saga and I would have liked to see the end of the Jedi and the Sith. I\u2019m sure that will never end and that probably would have made everyone pretty upset but I think for ending the Star Wars saga, that would have been a good way to do it.
