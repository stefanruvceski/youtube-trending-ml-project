After the Throne Room fight, Rey, pissed off at Luke and everything that happened, goes full dark side without hesitation.

Luke offers to finish Ben&#39;s training to stop Rey, who has become supreme leader of the First Order, making her the big bad of Episode 9.", "textOriginal": "Luke's arc was total garbage. Here is how you could have made this trilogy better:\n\n1.) Make it that, instead of Luke in pouty exile for trying to kill Ben as a kid, make that Kylo fell to the darkside similar to Anakin; however, make it that Luke confronts him as an adult, before Episode 7, similar to Obi-Wan and Anakin in Episode 3. Instead of Luke winning, make it that Kylo maims Luke physically, and wrecks his connection to the force (almost in an interesting role reversal from Vader). Luke isn't in exile out of some crap decisions he made, but because he is literally useless.\n\n2.) Make it so Rey goes darkside at the end of Episode 8. You can keep it so she is still Sidious's grand daughter, just don't make him alive. Make it so when Luke trains her in Episode 8 (desperate to stop rectify his failure from the point above) she still has an obvious, natural connection to the Dark Side. Fearful that he'll have a hand in creating another Kylo Ren, Luke refuses to train her. After the Throne Room fight, Rey, pissed off at Luke and everything that happened, goes full dark side without hesitation. This terrifies Kylo who, already feeling confilct from Han's death, sees how easy this was for Rey becomes motivated to rejoin the light side (do the opposite from Episode 8 and have Rey offer Kylo the chance to join her and he rejects her offer).\n\n3.) Have Ben save the Resistance at the end of Episode 8, find Luke, and reconcile.

I liked it for what it was. I agree that Ben solo/ Kylo Ren arc was the best part of the trilogy. Rey's arc isn't actually from left field. The Timothy Zahn Trilogy in the 80s had clones of Palpatine coming back, and had Leia's and Han's son turning to the dark side. They should have just borrowed from that series as their road map and fans would have loved it. \n\nThe core issue is how Rian Johnson just took what Abrahms had set up and took a shit on it.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-22T17:51:35.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-22T17:51:35.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/pKGoKKrPIlw1tSu1MFNT6CFoCj8\"", "id": "UgxBzNHT7X4KZU0P9MF4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/dl399pYgVmvTVMrkY4aTc3iAqy0\"", "id": "UgxBzNHT7X4KZU0P9MF4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Megan Leahey", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_Z_GxjqqZZbbCpJqOoJQeBEp7w-Ko3AcMAaA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOtKJ8ScVlriTn94l3kSNQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCiOtKJ8ScVlriTn94l3kSNQ"}, "videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "textDisplay": "Finn deserved so much more than being the sidekick to Rey.
