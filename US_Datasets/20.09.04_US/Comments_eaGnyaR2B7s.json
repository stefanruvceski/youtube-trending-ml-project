From that moment on we banned the operation of a machine with the door open and took a strict stance on it to the effect that if you operate a machine with the door open it would result in immediate termination. It was a difficult road to follow since that was so ingrained in our daily work but something so life changing was enough to drive change. The worker returned to work several years later.
