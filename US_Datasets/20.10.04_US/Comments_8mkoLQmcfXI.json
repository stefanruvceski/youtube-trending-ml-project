Last week, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington projected 93,531 deaths. On Sunday, the IMHE lowered its estimated to 81,766 deaths. Then on Wednesday, the projection dropped the estimated total deaths to 60,415.<br /><br />So, what does it all mean?<br /><br />The U.S. has the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world, with more than 435,000 cases and nearly 15,000 deaths. But projections from White House officials just a week ago \u2013 heavily covered by the mainstream media \u2013 put the death toll at 100,000 to 240,000 (a far cry from the 60,000 or so projected by the IMHE).<br /><br />Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter who worked for \u201cthe paper of record\u201d from 1999 to 2010, has been doing his own analysis of the ever-changing models and offered some thoughts in a Fox News interview.<br /><br />Berenson has been questioning the numbers for some time. He first challenged the model from the Imperial College in London, which initially said 500,000 Britons would die.
