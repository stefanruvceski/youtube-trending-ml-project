Chester County Industrial Development would not work with me to market this.  The proof was that it worked for me.  Being homeopathic anyone could knock it off.  It was simply a matter of putting a small spray bottle of apple cider vinegar in a box and putting it alongside all the cold medicines on the pharmacy shelves and being the first to market it and get acceptance and get market share.   \r<br />                                                                                                                                                                                             \r<br />                  Zicam is one of these products that is supposed to knock colds in a weeks time, never worked for me, the Rush Limbaugh miracle cold fixer, claimed it worked for him if I recall.  All the Zicam reports I read said it may work for you in about seven days. \r<br /> \r<br />                 I talked with a pharmacist at Rite Aid, and he knew about putting apple cider vinegar in your nose to relieve congestion, the only pharmacist I ever talked to who had any idea how this worked.  As for its effect on coronaviruses in the nose and nasal passages, the lower pH should keep them from multiplying, and the viruses would die off.  By not multiplying that would inhibit I would think the virus from becoming more full blown in the body.  But that all needs to be validated to go forward with government approval.   \r<br /> \r<br /> \r<br />It seems after all my endeavoring I finally came up with a why and how that this might actually knock off the coronaviruses in the lungs.  It was so simple.  You inhale it, stupid.\r<br />\r<br />I just could not imagine it.  I could only imagine it when it was incubating in the nose.\r<br />\r<br />So this would explain how Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar works that in swallowing it the acetic acid vapors go into the lungs and nasal passages.\r<br /> .\r<br /> \r<br />It should be easy to find out if this will work on coronaviruses.                                   \r<br />Doctors will never prescribe homeopathic solutions.\r<br /> \r<br />My idea to market this never got off the ground because it was homeopathic.

Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar is used by many who claim it works for them to prevent colds, most drinking it every day. \r\n        \r\n        Inhaling the Apple Cider Vinegar vapors which contain acetic acid which has a 2.4 pH as titrated could change the pH in the lungs so that the coronaviruses could not multiply and would die off and in not multiplying not letting the illness become more full blown.\r\n      In the last month, several times I have had a stuffy nose in the middle of the night and had difficulty breathing through my nostrils.   A dab of apple cider vinegar sprayed onto the tip of my left index finger and dabbed into both nostrils from a small Dollar Store spray bottle and the congestion was gone in five minutes, no telling if it killed off any cold germs or coronaviruses.\r\n \r\n       No More Colds  by William Wells.   Consult with your doctor before trying.\r\n \r\n  \r\n                 https://www.amazon.com/No-More-Colds-Search-Cure/dp/1534941738  \r\n                       \r\n \r\n                                                  \r\n \r\nDoctors will never prescribe homeopathic solutions.\r\n \r\nMy idea to market this never got off the ground because it was homeopathic.  Chester County Industrial Development would not work with me to market this.  The proof was that it worked for me.  Being homeopathic anyone could knock it off.  It was simply a matter of putting a small spray bottle of apple cider vinegar in a box and putting it alongside all the cold medicines on the pharmacy shelves and being the first to market it and get acceptance and get market share.   \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                             \r\n                  Zicam is one of these products that is supposed to knock colds in a weeks time, never worked for me, the Rush Limbaugh miracle cold fixer, claimed it worked for him if I recall.  All the Zicam reports I read said it may work for you in about seven days. \r\n \r\n                 I talked with a pharmacist at Rite Aid, and he knew about putting apple cider vinegar in your nose to relieve congestion, the only pharmacist I ever talked to who had any idea how this worked.  As for its effect on coronaviruses in the nose and nasal passages, the lower pH should keep them from multiplying, and the viruses would die off.  By not multiplying that would inhibit I would think the virus from becoming more full blown in the body.  But that all needs to be validated to go forward with government approval.   \r\n \r\n \r\nIt seems after all my endeavoring I finally came up with a why and how that this might actually knock off the coronaviruses in the lungs.  It was so simple.  You inhale it, stupid.\r\n\r\nI just could not imagine it.  I could only imagine it when it was incubating in the nose.\r\n\r\nSo this would explain how Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar works that in swallowing it the acetic acid vapors go into the lungs and nasal passages.\r\n .\r\n \r\nIt should be easy to find out if this will work on coronaviruses.                                   \r\nDoctors will never prescribe homeopathic solutions.\r\n \r\nMy idea to market this never got off the ground because it was homeopathic.
