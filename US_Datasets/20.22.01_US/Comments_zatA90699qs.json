Thank you oh so very much for this video. I think you made the interviews very genuine and personable. I am a school bus assistant in Colorado. My job is to help care for kids that need a safe ride to and from school that have autism and disabilities. I literally cried watching this video. Not because it made me sad, but because it made my heart so full! When I was younger, I used to be afraid of people with autism and disabilities. I was afraid.... because I wasn\u2019t aware of everyone else\u2019s way of living. (No it\u2019s not my parents fault! My mom always taught me to treat others how I wanted to be treated. I just didn\u2019t know mentally I needed to do that too, at that age). I was never rude or a bully.... but I was uneducated. Unfortunately a lot of bullying at school, on social media, etc. comes from being uneducated about a certain topic. At that time, we didn\u2019t know about the spectrum as much as we do now. And it makes me so proud that I am not afraid anymore because as I got older, I researched different things that I didn\u2019t understand... and now I have a job helping those who just need a friend. Who want someone to share their day with. To smile and laugh with someone, since at times, I\u2019m the only happy face they see. I am there when they Need Someone to talk to or play games with when everyone else squeezes them into this box and they feel down about how they are treated. Someone Who wants to learn new things. Someone who just wants to ride the bus safely and quietly. Someone Who wants to live a full happy life, just like the rest of us. Someone That doesn\u2019t let anything, including their disability, stand in their way. When others look down upon them, I am there to stand for them and be a voice when they don\u2019t always know how or can\u2019t be their own voice. I love my job, I love spreading the awareness, and I love that everyone views the world in different ways and that I can take that into consideration when speaking to anyone now. I have asthma, which is very different from autism, but it is a disability I have. People I know and have known for years always seem to forget that I have asthma and I can\u2019t always participate in the activities they do... so I can understand to a small degree of being put in that box of no one understanding me and my condition. It doesn\u2019t define me! But it is a part of who I am, but it doesn\u2019t make me any less of a person. I am not on the spectrum, but I understand it more thanks to my job, and having the ability to learn about it as well as connect to those who are looked at differently. I get it now. Now the world must know! Just treat others how YOU wanted to be treated. I truly appreciate you helping spread that awareness and thank you to your interviewers for coming to talk about the unique world they all live in\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffd Rock on my dude!

Ever since my school was told about my diagnosis I have been treated differently, like everyone is walking on eggshells around me and I hate it. It doesn&#39;t make me any less than others who do not have autism. Yeah okay I suck at social stuff and absolutely die inside in literally any social situation but i am getting better. It doesn&#39;t come naturally to me but that doesn&#39;t mean I cannot learn. Autism is different for every person affected, and for me the worst parts are:<br />Sounds are LOUD.<br />Warm is HOT.<br />Cold is FREEZING.<br />Awful awful awful panic attacks, where I just shut down and it is basically like I am not a person anymore. My hearing is muffled but at the same time everything is so loud, my vision is blurry, I feel like i could faint at any moment and it just feels like the whole world is closing in on me.<br />I cannot function in a social situation much longer than 30 minutes before I shut down - this is literally any situation with one or more people that I am not super close with, like my amazing Mum :) I can&#39;t even stay with some of my family for over half an hour. Before my diagnosis this pissed my teachers off so much hah. <br />Also it made my social anxiety disorder (abbreviated to S.A.D - very ironic) ten times worse than the average person with the diagnosis (of s.a.d)<br />It&#39;s so hard to concentrate. I have a seriously hard time making friends and keeping friends. mainly because I just prefer my own company because it is safer and it won&#39;t make me have a panic attack (most of the time...)<br /><br /><br />Okay I&#39;m bored but yeah that&#39;s most of it but yet there is still so much more to it. Autism sucks but it also has some good to it. It made me super artistic and musical, and though I am definitely not the best at it, it definitely gave me a true passion that hasn&#39;t disappeared at all. It also makes it so I know any friend that sticks around is a true friend. <br /><br /><br />Though, I actually haven&#39;t told any of my &#39;friends&#39; (not that I have any good ones).
