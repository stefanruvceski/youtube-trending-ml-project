We are herded through the office so quickly I don&#39;t think our primary doctors take the time to understand our mental health. I&#39;ve seen doctors even ignore the mention of depression after they asked the patient if he was depressed.<br /><br />The issue is that are the primary doctors just throwing more pills at us or are they actually helping to treat mental health? There are people taking antidepressants for years, but they are still in the same condition. Patients can spend years having dosages changed without any real resolution or improvement.

Therefore, the disconnect with your view and Lady Gaga. Most of us spend most of our time during our doctor visits with nurses and only see the doctor for 10 minutes. We are herded through the office so quickly I don't think our primary doctors take the time to understand our mental health. I've seen doctors even ignore the mention of depression after they asked the patient if he was depressed.\n\nThe issue is that are the primary doctors just throwing more pills at us or are they actually helping to treat mental health? There are people taking antidepressants for years, but they are still in the same condition. Patients can spend years having dosages changed without any real resolution or improvement.

I think both the statement Gaga made, and the statements made in this video are correct. Nothing is quite so black and white as you both made it out to be.<br /><br />I would reject anything my pcp wanted to put me on as far as psychiatric meds go, not because I don&#39;t trust her, but rather because I see my hematologist and other specialists far more often than I do my pcp. I have more trust in someone who will see me 4-8x a year than someone who sees me once.<br /><br />Additionally, I&#39;d much rather be evaluated by a specialist than my pcp. A longterm mapped out treatment plan that I can discuss in depth and fully understand is better than a 3 question test to determine if I&#39;ve become depressed/more depressed and just prescribing whatever med based on my bodyweight and age. Because that&#39;s what&#39;s done. Or sometimes a referral is given to go see a psychiatrist, but not as often. <br /><br />Not to mention the tons of cases where a psychiatrist has to ween the patient off of the wrong meds to put them on the right meds. Meds given by a pcp. And I think that that&#39;s the crux of the point being made. If pcps mainly keep a once or twice a year tally, hand out referrals or are meant to discuss further options with you which in a lot of cases involve a specialist, then why are they giving you a prescription for something that&#39;s going to thoroughly alter the chemical balance of your body? I wouldn&#39;t go to a pcp for heart surgery, but I would ask her for a recommendation or referral to a cardiologist. <br /><br />The mental health sector is strained because there&#39;s not enough general funding, not because of the amount of ppl going to see psychiatrists or psychologists. For that reason a pcp definitely should be a first step for those with access to more, and should be trained to handle basic cases properly if access isn&#39;t available for a patient.", "textOriginal": "I'm torn about this.

Nothing is quite so black and white as you both made it out to be.\n\nI would reject anything my pcp wanted to put me on as far as psychiatric meds go, not because I don't trust her, but rather because I see my hematologist and other specialists far more often than I do my pcp. I have more trust in someone who will see me 4-8x a year than someone who sees me once.\n\nAdditionally, I'd much rather be evaluated by a specialist than my pcp. A longterm mapped out treatment plan that I can discuss in depth and fully understand is better than a 3 question test to determine if I've become depressed/more depressed and just prescribing whatever med based on my bodyweight and age. Because that's what's done. Or sometimes a referral is given to go see a psychiatrist, but not as often. \n\nNot to mention the tons of cases where a psychiatrist has to ween the patient off of the wrong meds to put them on the right meds. Meds given by a pcp. And I think that that's the crux of the point being made. If pcps mainly keep a once or twice a year tally, hand out referrals or are meant to discuss further options with you which in a lot of cases involve a specialist, then why are they giving you a prescription for something that's going to thoroughly alter the chemical balance of your body? I wouldn't go to a pcp for heart surgery, but I would ask her for a recommendation or referral to a cardiologist. \n\nThe mental health sector is strained because there's not enough general funding, not because of the amount of ppl going to see psychiatrists or psychologists. For that reason a pcp definitely should be a first step for those with access to more, and should be trained to handle basic cases properly if access isn't available for a patient.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-22T07:18:09.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-22T07:18:09.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/MidqgT9iL1gEmU6m8o9VbTMhlMo\"", "id": "UgxDoUxvNooUOqu634h4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/iB3dLdSaPAajcj4VcwjU3VvLJ10\"", "id": "UgxDoUxvNooUOqu634h4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Shree Nation", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-2KiaHVQU3Th5plDVQyP-jwVJfxbl6RxzM2A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv-nRQPpYJ31YjmILGZJI9A", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCv-nRQPpYJ31YjmILGZJI9A"}, "videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "textDisplay": "The day I ask celebrities for medical advice is the day I ask Doctor Mike for a lingerie shoot", "textOriginal": "The day I ask celebrities for medical advice is the day I ask Doctor Mike for a lingerie shoot", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-22T06:51:41.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-22T06:51:41.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/Ri65brARbMDshffDfMUYQz_QoEs\"", "id": "UgxXiWecPoCd-HJu9JJ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/TfMaG9b1EemYMIFKr8gxg70apYw\"", "id": "UgxXiWecPoCd-HJu9JJ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Serenity Wilson", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79AihPzXZIpdPM4CyvXENS5pISn_PY9kKeQkQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-TaE_PXO2L5zfkmx1Y1uSw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-TaE_PXO2L5zfkmx1Y1uSw"}, "videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "textDisplay": "Mental health treatment is unfortunately expensive in America and very difficult to get for those that may need it most", "textOriginal": "Mental health treatment is unfortunately expensive in America and very difficult to get for those that may need it most", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-22T06:25:37.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-22T06:25:37.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/vxAlAgrTbnIg40zbSUb8g_OVo8o\"", "id": "Ugwv9ZflzetwhWVNgqp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/3e-lCwjQL2ZMVU0ZwXIm7C6mCnA\"", "id": "Ugwv9ZflzetwhWVNgqp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "englandsensation", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78MN_yt8o6Eu4bpigFCzJ3_bIF3SwvT9egKVg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEjifG5z-3n2KMK55CiNiJw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEjifG5z-3n2KMK55CiNiJw"}, "videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "textDisplay": "Please react to the &#39;what the health&#39; documentary.", "textOriginal": "Please react to the 'what the health' documentary.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-22T06:20:10.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-22T06:20:10.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/tSxm7wKYsKujp7iTlF2XcXwMXNc\"", "id": "UgztgnlWY6LePj8X-oB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/U81tzC-NdcDBHAUTjZ3XfNxe-_8\"", "id": "UgztgnlWY6LePj8X-oB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Mickaella Douglas", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-EtiJ33WhrI4aJGoXfsIZZdAUz4MVHzBP1Tg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr4RC6bsPQLD0BjpkTx3DgA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCr4RC6bsPQLD0BjpkTx3DgA"}, "videoId": "FudoiSkcTv8", "textDisplay": "Either Dr Mike has great eye shadow or he&#39;s sleep-deprived.
