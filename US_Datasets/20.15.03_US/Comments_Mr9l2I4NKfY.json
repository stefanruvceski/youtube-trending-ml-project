It isn\u2019t just that the media are racist and blatantly, unrepentantly attack Meghan in the lowest possible ways\u2026 It is also that the royal family stood by in stony silence and left them hanging out there. British journalist Arthur Edwards commented on their last round of appearances prior to commonwealth day and said he really just couldn\u2019t understand why they would want to leave Britain and what follows is my comments to that particular interview:  \u201cI guess you missed out on the part where their newborn son Archie who was only a few days old was compared to a chimpanzee and no one from the royal family came out and expressed outrage to say enough is enough and back this young couple up. Their son, seventh in line of succession to the throne, compared to a chimpanzee and the palace is SILENCE! And I guess you missed two really good articles that outlined in detail the racist threats of harm and sometimes death to Meghan prior to marrying Harry and then to Harry himself culminating in a neo Nazi assassination plot because they deemed him a race traitor\u2026 RF remained SILENT!! There was even death threats and a bomb scare on their wedding day.  One of the two articles outlined in detail just how many staff hours had to be spent combing through the social media of the palace and the social media of the Sussex\u2019s that contained overt racism and threats to Meghan and Harry and horrific comments about their baby\u2026 Having to comb through all of these things sent to the social media and then block the senders and report the threats for investigation to Scotland Yard.... but the palace remains SILENT!! This couple is basically shoved out into the world with a gag in their mouth\u2018s and their hands tied behind their back\u2018s and forced to take beatings every single day and denied the right to defend themselves because they\u2019re \u201croyal\u201c. There is no way that Meghan could possibly feel safe in an environment like that and there is no way that she would feel that her child was safe in an environment like that. And I don\u2019t think she is responsible for pulling Harry away\u2026 She more than likely asked to step back on her own in a private conversation with Prince Harry and come out only when there was an event they had to do together.  She wasn\u2019t stupid\u2026 She knew exactly who she married and the life that he was born into and what the expectations on him were. She would not have asked him to drop all of that\u2026 It\u2019s more likely that she had to admit defeat and trying to do any independent appearances. The royal family could also have made a point of stepping up side-by-side appearances with them in public showing family bonds and camaraderie for several months to help them get past this tide of completely off the wall hate speech\u2026 But the RF did nothing. And instead of having compassion for her they seemed to develop an isolating resentment of her that was not present in what they did and said but in what they didn\u2019t do and what they didn\u2019t say. The unspoken words were \u201cwhy did you have to be a woman of color? Why did you have to be American? Why did you have to be confident and have a voice of your own when you arrived? Why couldn\u2019t you just be demure and nothing special in your own right? Just show up look pretty and obedient and shut up!\u201c Does that answer your particularly naive question? And let\u2019s talk about Prince William for a moment. When prince harry was asked by ITV reporter while in Africa about the reported rift between he and Willam Prince Harry commented that \u201cmuch of it was made up out of nothing and that like all brothers do, you have your good days and your bad days, your ups and downs but at the end of the day we\u2019re brothers, we\u2019ll always be brothers, I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me... We are certainly on different paths at the moment and we don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy but I love him dearly.\u201c  but at no time has Prince William ever issued any public statement of support for his brother and what he was going through, not even when his brother\u2018s new baby, an heir to the throne, his own nephew was compared to a chimpanzee. Instead, when they finally make known their desire to step back as senior Royals Prince William makes sure a statement makes it into the headlines \u201cI find I can no longer put my arm around my brother\u201c. That was cold and, for me, defined the kind of man or lack of man that Prince William truly is. And Diana would likely not forgive him for that ... it is well documented that Diana was always very concerned about her younger son Harry and how he would actually find his way when he was always going to be just the spare and then not even the spare after William started having children\u2026So, Can you try to spend five seconds in their shoes thinking about all that and then ask your question again? I would give anything to write a letter to the queen, and a respectful manner but outlining the stuff in really clearly stated defined terms point by point by point\u2026 Because they clearly are not capable of seeing it because they do not live in the real world. ( BTW, I wouldn\u2019t waste any words on Charles and Willam because they are so arrogant and clearly see themselves as \u201cbetter than\u201c.
