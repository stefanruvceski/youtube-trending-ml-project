Surely by no means and they can never find an antidote vaccine for it as they claim, no matter what they announced, do not let them seduce you! By Allah, they are indeed liars [although it is a tiny living creature from Allah\u2019s hidden soldiers] even if the entire human physicians met for it; even if they were aiders and supporter to each other they can not and could never be able, by Allah\u2019s permission, in order for you to know that you do not encompass a thing of His knowledge except in what He pleases, glory be to Him. but you are atheist people and you will indeed see what you did not expect from the scheme of Allah\u2019s unknown soldier (Corona-virus) the suffocator. And Allah leads them on (to destruction) by means of His intelligent hidden way to get to whom Allah pleases of their elite from where they do not know, and see international health organization do not consider it an international disease yet! For the fact with their claim they will control it yet they indeed are liars. How can they control Allah\u2019s chastisement?!\r<br />But the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni a khalifa of Allah over the worlds I issue fatwa to you with Truth that it is not a mere international disease in fact an international chastisement, and since it is a sort of the minor chastisement before the major chastisement then definitely (number) of death is few initially but now the infected ones are in millions and many of them they do not know that they are infected and this is a cunning from Allah so they infect other people they think themselves are secure from Allah\u2019s chastisement the suffocating to the respiratory system so it would constrict on him breathing air little by little as if he elevates up in the sky until he suffocates because of the constriction of his respiratory system and its channel, so how will Allah not afflict the arrogant ones of whom Allah pleases from among them as admonishment to the worlds for they may return back to their True Lord by pleading and supplicating to remove His chastisement away from them promising Allah to follow His Book the grand Quran and asking Allah steadfastness Who comes between them and their hearts so they would beseech from Allah to make their hearts steadfast to fulfill what they promised Him to avoid them His chastisement then removes it away from them to follow His Book the grand Quran so they be of these who are guided aright.\r<br />\r<br />And with what I want to seal this explanatory-statement of mine is the call from Allah in His decisive Book during an admonition of His chastisement by the chest disease. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {O people, there has come to you indeed an admonition from your Lord and a healing for what is in the chests; and a guidance and a mercy for the believers.}Truthful Allah the Great [Younus] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgBla7RepXU&amp;t=10m57s\">10:57</a>..

Surely by no means and they can never find an antidote vaccine for it as they claim, no matter what they announced, do not let them seduce you! By Allah, they are indeed liars [although it is a tiny living creature from Allah\u2019s hidden soldiers] even if the entire human physicians met for it; even if they were aiders and supporter to each other they can not and could never be able, by Allah\u2019s permission, in order for you to know that you do not encompass a thing of His knowledge except in what He pleases, glory be to Him. but you are atheist people and you will indeed see what you did not expect from the scheme of Allah\u2019s unknown soldier (Corona-virus) the suffocator. And Allah leads them on (to destruction) by means of His intelligent hidden way to get to whom Allah pleases of their elite from where they do not know, and see international health organization do not consider it an international disease yet! For the fact with their claim they will control it yet they indeed are liars. How can they control Allah\u2019s chastisement?!\r\nBut the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni a khalifa of Allah over the worlds I issue fatwa to you with Truth that it is not a mere international disease in fact an international chastisement, and since it is a sort of the minor chastisement before the major chastisement then definitely (number) of death is few initially but now the infected ones are in millions and many of them they do not know that they are infected and this is a cunning from Allah so they infect other people they think themselves are secure from Allah\u2019s chastisement the suffocating to the respiratory system so it would constrict on him breathing air little by little as if he elevates up in the sky until he suffocates because of the constriction of his respiratory system and its channel, so how will Allah not afflict the arrogant ones of whom Allah pleases from among them as admonishment to the worlds for they may return back to their True Lord by pleading and supplicating to remove His chastisement away from them promising Allah to follow His Book the grand Quran and asking Allah steadfastness Who comes between them and their hearts so they would beseech from Allah to make their hearts steadfast to fulfill what they promised Him to avoid them His chastisement then removes it away from them to follow His Book the grand Quran so they be of these who are guided aright.\r\n\r\nAnd with what I want to seal this explanatory-statement of mine is the call from Allah in His decisive Book during an admonition of His chastisement by the chest disease.
