And i gave birth vaginally. My daughter weighed 8# 3.5 oz. and i didnt feel any contractions until 7 hours after they started my induction. They put my epidural in 8 hours after induction. And as they were taping up the catheter of the epidural-i started pushing her out. None of the nurses knew it. The Doctor wasnt there either. So my doctor showed up less than 2 minutes before her head came out. Its was very strange. Anesthesia staff stayed in the room just in case something happened. When my daughter came out she was very sleepy. They had trouble waking her up. But she did wake up just took a minute. And as of today, she is 22 yrs old and is a Bio major in college. And is a beautiful, productive member of society. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "textOriginal": "I was induced. And i gave birth vaginally.

But I think if I wasn\u2019t so stressed about being anxious and nervous about labor I could\u2019ve done it. My baby was stuck in the birth canal forever so when she was born here head was like five inches long lmao pero don\u2019t worry it went back to normal. They wanted to use the vacuum pero me mov\u00ed de posici\u00f3n de rodillas I como que bajo poquito y cuando ya me dieron m\u00e1s ganas de pushar y sali\u00f3 y si se me rompi\u00f3 poquito all\u00e1 pero lo arreglaron y todav\u00eda pues est\u00e1 bien la cookie lol. Pero tu puedes hermosa tu como dices primero el babies health!  Relax relax relax y deja que te de masajee tu hombre y a cuando sea tiempo tu y tu cuerpo van a saber que son lo mejor para ti y tu baby!  Best of wishes girl! You got this! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-13T22:23:43.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-13T22:23:43.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/ZE9miu-nsXOTjLC-i4Kk-20SSz0\"", "id": "Ugw7uiNoRNTrys2Z8a14AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "sg8WaeeFyNY", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/5jnXE0WhJxAf_RZs0zy1TaqKkhU\"", "id": "Ugw7uiNoRNTrys2Z8a14AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Veridiana Lasalle", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78xLOjkidl3a1OYuMvXa2_vs_7OtDIyZ29L0Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfyI5XQsw9jyMSa1nSXnPKQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfyI5XQsw9jyMSa1nSXnPKQ"}, "videoId": "sg8WaeeFyNY", "textDisplay": "Do whatever is best for you,you the one who us going to be in labor and you will have a lot of help.I gave birth to my daughter and she was 10 lbs and 5 ounces and i gave  birth natural but they dislocated her arm and they cut me but everything heal great and she is big and beautiful.Have a great labor .DTB", "textOriginal": "Do whatever is best for you,you the one who us going to be in labor and you will have a lot of help.I gave birth to my daughter and she was 10 lbs and 5 ounces and i gave  birth natural but they dislocated her arm and they cut me but everything heal great and she is big and beautiful.Have a great labor .DTB", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-13T22:19:49.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-13T22:19:49.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/k8Z2taS-K-cjEuE_vd16TqafCtk\"", "id": "Ugz-lWMoZdFeSuapb2F4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "sg8WaeeFyNY", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/0eFR3N1yMUW9uUqTJyGfZyt-jUY\"", "id": "Ugz-lWMoZdFeSuapb2F4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Carla Avila", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l785IcnByeP5S-pJtlHnC16Eg9eq-ygH4Ug78Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6RMnPbA0TTkjNNcLqD9D8A", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6RMnPbA0TTkjNNcLqD9D8A"}, "videoId": "sg8WaeeFyNY", "textDisplay": "Aw, how precious babyG such a cacheton \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99 Prayers! \u2764\ufe0f", "textOriginal": "Aw, how precious babyG such a cacheton \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99 Prayers! \u2764\ufe0f", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-13T22:17:24.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-13T22:17:24.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/QBiUbyWXB0FOrMxvMEDwf0BEjno\"", "id": "Ugwi19JevdU1s4MP97x4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "sg8WaeeFyNY", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/9vpcIwRs10j_sKLZ6vlt6deUsrs\"", "id": "Ugwi19JevdU1s4MP97x4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "ryan globlek", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78QZ9tc0QGn34TrkdSUFM_HIxnVKOg1zuAanA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBYV7bNLamQvBkgtXg3mjw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwBYV7bNLamQvBkgtXg3mjw"}, "videoId": "sg8WaeeFyNY", "textDisplay": "Baby&#39;s are born everyday...and this is the one that&#39;s trending", "textOriginal": "Baby's are born everyday...and this is the one that's trending", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-13T22:16:12.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-13T22:16:12.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/UNE1LzVhvDLOz135G6evxsC7B9Y\"", "id": "UgzJ_SGjZChvlsHxzGB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "sg8WaeeFyNY", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/gdT7jDL_3BWc_O21mrtmQpSqqnw\"", "id": "UgzJ_SGjZChvlsHxzGB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Karen Grau", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79UV6iXbhBAGclBXeJQstTMqg67GxqcHSNFoA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8j3aQmArVehL_EKlDKTEsQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8j3aQmArVehL_EKlDKTEsQ"}, "videoId": "sg8WaeeFyNY", "textDisplay": "I was at a 1cm and got induced at 39week.
