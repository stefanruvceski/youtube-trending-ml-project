I didn&#39;t like The Force Awakens (it felt too much like a clone of A New Hope), and I didn&#39;t like The Last Jedi (too much random garbage that didn&#39;t make sense). But honestly, I really liked The Rise of Skywalker, to the point that it started to make me like the other two movies better. Here&#39;s how I think about it. After my disappointment with The Last Jedi, I started thinking about how I would have written this sequel trilogy. And one of the big things that caught my eye in this movie was Palpatine. That was one of the main plot points as I&#39;d written it - that Palpatine would return as a clone in another body (it&#39;s from an expanded universe thing). And the reason why I think that works is this. The ending of Return of the Jedi is nice, but it isn&#39;t very logical. The war hasn&#39;t ended, the Empire isn&#39;t dead, and Anakin hasn&#39;t brought balance to the Force. The movie wants us to think those things are true, but they aren&#39;t. More importantly, the main things tying the two trilogies together were Anakin and Palpatine. Really, those movies were their story. And Anakin died at the end of The Last Jedi. He could - and should - have shown up as a Force ghost or something like that, but he could never play a huge role in the new trilogy. And that means that we need Palpatine to return as the main antagonist. If he wasn&#39;t in the new trilogy, it would have felt disconnected from the original two. Snoke and Kylo Ren - however much they may have evolved - started life as bargain-basket Palpatine and Vader. They needed more than that. They needed the original characters to come back and fill those roles, and they needed their own story.<br />As far as the movie itself goes, I loved it. It was not perfect - too much of the Disney brand of comedy, which sickens my to my cynical core - but it was really good. It had almost the same runtime as The Last Jedi, but where The Last Jedi felt long and pointless, The Rise of Skywalker made good use of its runtime. Not a minute was wasted. And honestly, I liked the story and the dozen character arcs. It felt balanced and fast-paced at the same time, and I liked that. More importantly, though, it captured the feeling that the original Star Wars had - that feeling of a movie that looked like sci-fi, but felt like fantasy. That sense was very strong in The Rise of Skywalker. Whereas The Last Jedi felt more like it was trying to be hard science fiction, but not doing very well because it&#39;s Star Wars, The Rise of Skywalker felt almost like high fantasy, but in space. It embraced that sense. I dunno, maybe I&#39;m rambling. But I really liked it.", "textOriginal": "My opinion on this movie is honestly almost the opposite of yours.
