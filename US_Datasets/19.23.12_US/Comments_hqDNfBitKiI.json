For me, I didn't see it, and I decided that the minute I walked out of TLJ. The Disney Star Wars was dead to me, as dead as Luke. From my POV, spending more money for Ep. 9 is not allowing your voice to be heard. If you need to see it, torrent it and watch it alone or with star wars fans and drink a bottle and shed some tears. But adding to the Disney pot is supporting their decisions on how they put out this sequel, and how they portrayed our childhood heros. From my POV anyone who says Luke from TLJ was fine, or loved it, has some sort of agenda and is not being honest.

I think the sequels will be regarded the same way as the prequels were. Hated, then tolerated. Then loved by some, and I feel like this third sequel was the revenge of the sith for this generation. I loved it. Just the same as I hated the first two prequels when it came out, now I regard them as fun and totally good movies, but just not as good as the rest.

I honestly feel sad for them not liking it and having some of my best friends tell me they don&#39;t feel passionate about Star Wars because of this movie ... I felt that with TLJ, but this movie restaured my live and faith in the franchise and it left me with a good feeling as well. And most importantly as a lifelong fan of this franchise I DID NOT FEEL DISRESPECTED like I did in TLJ! Yes, Disney should have planned the triology from the get go and not made the mistakes they did, but at least they had the dignity to fix it and maintain the Star Wars Universe alive.
