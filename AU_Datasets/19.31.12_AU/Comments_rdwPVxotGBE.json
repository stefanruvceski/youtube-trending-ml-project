The sequel trilogies lack of oversight is clear, but the movies are all enjoyable as separate experiences. When watching them back to back the cracks become evident, however, these cracks are still not enough to ruin the experience for me. I have loved Star Wars since I was first exposed to it and I can enjoy just about any Star Wars movie despite all of its flaws (including the prequels).", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T22:45:29.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-30T22:45:29.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/202B2-rs_sQWIOc2lVr8nms3Vvo\"", "id": "UgwPDp9j5Xgw_7bf6Hd4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/SpBoalSZ037a7olCqGaHV0SsOlw\"", "id": "UgwPDp9j5Xgw_7bf6Hd4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "AkIRA_22 Game-O-Rama", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_i2op_GVS4mTiuMPQmgHCIe1Ib5WFEKxriJQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDHKTt2QbSVE3QsTOG21rZw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDHKTt2QbSVE3QsTOG21rZw"}, "videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "textDisplay": "Lots of different opinions is good, that&#39;s basically the aim of story telling, the individual taking away what they want.", "textOriginal": "Lots of different opinions is good, that's basically the aim of story telling, the individual taking away what they want.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T22:44:21.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-30T22:44:21.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/NVFCVTJm_02Kt7MgkfJuOevvEgA\"", "id": "Ugx0XXyjuqNlmiegpVN4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/aP_alvuIqMV_0Tp3JxDO46nH88Y\"", "id": "Ugx0XXyjuqNlmiegpVN4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Wet Bum", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_MF2D8IcNC_DiuzZlO2BR5BJGztwxW6PDNzA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6zB13XEQzX2e2XJV0T_xDw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6zB13XEQzX2e2XJV0T_xDw"}, "videoId": "rdwPVxotGBE", "textDisplay": "Am I the only one who liked it?

Abrams almost went overboard with the spectacle of this movie but still produced cohesive action scenes. Palpatine seemed rushed but it made sense by the power of his character and from the stance of the filmmaker. Kylo Ren had an incredible arch that concluded so well in this movie.

It&#39;s one of my favorite star Wars movies already.", "textOriginal": "I saw the Force Awakens a couple times and never really felt that it jumped out of the screen at me, the story was not original, the visuals were eh and Rey was just a big Mary Sue. The Last Jedi made sequences from other films make no sense. Johnson took many liberties with the physics of Jedi and Spacecrafts. He introduced themes in the 8th movie of a franchise about the Skywalkers that were completely irrelevant. And it was an hour longer than it needed to be. It was the first time in a movie theater that I've almost fallen asleep. When I rewatched the movie on Netflix I saw the flaws in everything even clearer, example: throne room fight choreography. The only bad parts of Rise for me were the repetitive fan service, the constant jokes from C-3PO and the things Abrams kept in the background from TLJ. Abrams almost went overboard with the spectacle of this movie but still produced cohesive action scenes. Palpatine seemed rushed but it made sense by the power of his character and from the stance of the filmmaker. Kylo Ren had an incredible arch that concluded so well in this movie. The force energy and life force elements were so well done.
