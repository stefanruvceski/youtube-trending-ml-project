I can give my thoughts on it if you need anything, and I won\u2019t spoil.<br /><br />The best description I can give this film is, that it\u2019s a thrill ride.  The adrenaline rush is cranked up all the way from beginning to end.  Perhaps as a way to make up for lost time.<br /><br />You don\u2019t think about things, because it doesn\u2019t give you time to.  But if you stop and think about the moments you\u2019re concerned about, you find it touches on a lot of them.  Not in the best, or most elaborate of ways, but it does touch upon them.  Why Rey does things so easily, what is Snoke, Rey\u2019s parents(who they were and what happened to them), Palpatine\u2019s survival, etc.<br /><br />If you\u2019re wanting to think about things, this is a film that has a lot of two minute explanations that may not quite satisfy.  But if you are looking for a film that is a roller coaster from beginning to end this definitely satisfies and you do get a rush at the end of it.<br /><br />And the choice of Palpatine?  Well, I think it makes sense.  To me anyway.  It paints him as the main baddie throughout the entire saga, even if he isn\u2019t in all of it.  It starts with him, and it ends with him.  It also serves as an end to the Skywalker saga in one way, but may begin it in another asking a question of \u2018What\u2019s in a name?\u2019<br /><br />Does this film end the Skywalker saga?  Yes it does.  Can it continue beyond this?  Yes, it can.  Should it continue?  That\u2019s a question I can\u2019t answer, and won\u2019t try to.<br /><br />I\u2019ve seen some hater entries so far as \u2018the Fandom Menace\u2019 is likely out in full force.  I\u2019ve taken them off my recommendations list of videos when they cross my screen.  This is not me retreating into a bubble, but me believing they have nothing to offer the conversation.  The hate they offer doesn\u2019t provide anything constructive.  It is mostly for clickbait purposes, and just encourages people to be....their worst selves.  Not their best.  So the only thing to say about the Fandom Menace is.....\u201dYou have nothing to offer me.\u201d...and you can quote me on that.<br /><br />I expect you\u2019ll give your grade, but for me I give Rise of Skywalker a B-.<br /><br />Hope you read this Chris, and I hope this contributes to your Stuckmannization (I know, that\u2019s not a word) of \u2018The Rise of Skywalker\u2019.  But the trick of enjoying the film here is don\u2019t think too much about it.  Sit back, enjoy the ride.

The adrenaline rush is cranked up all the way from beginning to end.  Perhaps as a way to make up for lost time.\n\nYou don\u2019t think about things, because it doesn\u2019t give you time to.  But if you stop and think about the moments you\u2019re concerned about, you find it touches on a lot of them.  Not in the best, or most elaborate of ways, but it does touch upon them.  Why Rey does things so easily, what is Snoke, Rey\u2019s parents(who they were and what happened to them), Palpatine\u2019s survival, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting to think about things, this is a film that has a lot of two minute explanations that may not quite satisfy.  But if you are looking for a film that is a roller coaster from beginning to end this definitely satisfies and you do get a rush at the end of it.\n\nAnd the choice of Palpatine?  Well, I think it makes sense.  To me anyway.  It paints him as the main baddie throughout the entire saga, even if he isn\u2019t in all of it.  It starts with him, and it ends with him.  It also serves as an end to the Skywalker saga in one way, but may begin it in another asking a question of \u2018What\u2019s in a name?\u2019\n\nDoes this film end the Skywalker saga?  Yes it does.  Can it continue beyond this?  Yes, it can.  Should it continue?  That\u2019s a question I can\u2019t answer, and won\u2019t try to.\n\nI\u2019ve seen some hater entries so far as \u2018the Fandom Menace\u2019 is likely out in full force.  I\u2019ve taken them off my recommendations list of videos when they cross my screen.  This is not me retreating into a bubble, but me believing they have nothing to offer the conversation.  The hate they offer doesn\u2019t provide anything constructive.  It is mostly for clickbait purposes, and just encourages people to be....their worst selves.  Not their best.  So the only thing to say about the Fandom Menace is.....\u201dYou have nothing to offer me.\u201d...and you can quote me on that.\n\nI expect you\u2019ll give your grade, but for me I give Rise of Skywalker a B-.\n\nHope you read this Chris, and I hope this contributes to your Stuckmannization (I know, that\u2019s not a word) of \u2018The Rise of Skywalker\u2019.  But the trick of enjoying the film here is don\u2019t think too much about it.  Sit back, enjoy the ride.

How disliked [insert character name, arc, relationship, storyline] \" I feel it suffers from simular things like \"The Beauty and the Beast Remake\", looking in the fandoms and trying to please everyone with the addition of the job to clean up \"The Last Jedi\".", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-21T12:43:30.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-21T12:43:30.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/Idg9ZzKPvV8vV94a9jvFqM5JsEg\"", "id": "Ugw2NAm6vpE63SGqdm54AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "dDKy-jsJWEA", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/Iu-MJt_qeVFMQy7joWA384PxlBg\"", "id": "Ugw2NAm6vpE63SGqdm54AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Olivia Williams", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78StqRXjm7NUjQn8BPoM7_wn5t3Q29-Nm7dzg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy_KiVliPCpS7PX6uieJp-g", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCy_KiVliPCpS7PX6uieJp-g"}, "videoId": "dDKy-jsJWEA", "textDisplay": "In defence of the Canto Bytes part of TLJ, it\u2019s very important to set up the themes of the movie, it\u2019s thereto contrast and reinforce Luke and Rei part of the movie, lot of it have to do with Rose, about failure and saving what we love not destroying what you hate.", "textOriginal": "In defence of the Canto Bytes part of TLJ, it\u2019s very important to set up the themes of the movie, it\u2019s thereto contrast and reinforce Luke and Rei part of the movie, lot of it have to do with Rose, about failure and saving what we love not destroying what you hate.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-21T12:43:17.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-21T12:43:17.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/96F2DgK8WY51rI8gP99R6Z8uy_E\"", "id": "Ugw8yIeQ22NGoUTxUFd4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "dDKy-jsJWEA", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/4I5PBaId9W2yUPbzlD9lb4hGihU\"", "id": "Ugw8yIeQ22NGoUTxUFd4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Ban Yarling", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79g8EbYPS-Oso6FZirrbPC6xka2wsKif1bAWQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6De7YztJg-cFZcFSeUsuyw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6De7YztJg-cFZcFSeUsuyw"}, "videoId": "dDKy-jsJWEA", "textDisplay": "Wow Chris, did you make enough excuses for this disaster of a shameless cash grab?", "textOriginal": "Wow Chris, did you make enough excuses for this disaster of a shameless cash grab?", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-21T12:43:16.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-21T12:43:16.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/InLT8w7y0QC8HL3MzCFllixsvL0\"", "id": "UgxSpi6Cs-3NSN8hBF94AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "dDKy-jsJWEA", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/4dnWImNX4vP-asrhAVi7Y1TCD2U\"", "id": "UgxSpi6Cs-3NSN8hBF94AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Prodigy Of Rock", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_T3LgKHOKywjMeiDNOHvHPrU7zUceSPeBUZA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfVpTaTJdm2BsnXBwe2B-sQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfVpTaTJdm2BsnXBwe2B-sQ"}, "videoId": "dDKy-jsJWEA", "textDisplay": "this movie..................................happened <b>sigh</b>", "textOriginal": "this movie..................................happened *sigh*", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-21T12:34:09.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-21T12:34:09.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/xvyofypBjR1KlrsNlGfu6iT5Nms\"", "id": "Ugw2b6kyMGnPZGvJ2wx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "dDKy-jsJWEA", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/KiolGWdj1T9SfFvH1aqVEjkZu4k\"", "id": "Ugw2b6kyMGnPZGvJ2wx4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "SeanO Covers1999", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l78Tugne1f1x3Wxk5j17o1iUF-2FjRFvlpgpeQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeO4RaADnCaNxN_dY3Tsppg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeO4RaADnCaNxN_dY3Tsppg"}, "videoId": "dDKy-jsJWEA", "textDisplay": "I really liked this movie.
