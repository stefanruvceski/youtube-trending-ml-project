Can you imagine the Sith lord having sexual relations, and a family! But OK, even if somehow the Emperor had children, they would be Siths of his race, not humans, while Rey is obviously a human. It as laughable as if Yoda had children or Sauron from the Lord of the Rings had children. And there are many other stupid script decisions and plot holes which are mentioned by others. What makes me really angry, is that the new &quot;sequel&quot; pollutes and ruins the idea of older episodes. And why is it called &quot;The return of Skywalker, it should have beeen called &quot;The return of Palpatine&quot; since only the Palapatine dynasty survives. Disney have turned this great movie into a real soap opera using the soap opera technics. Maybe in a next episode we should expect the return of Yoda and maybe find out that Anakin was Yoda&#39;s grandchild, and meanwhile the Emperor&#39;s twin brother appears!", "textOriginal": "The stupid and illogical plot ruins the movie and the whole saga. By bringing the Emperor back they literally spit on the whole idea of Episopdes 1-6. Why was Anakins/Vader sacrifice needed then? The Emperor is alive again, and everything Luke and Vader did turned out to be failure... Not to mention the ridiculous plot twist that Rey turned out to be the Emperor's granddaughter. When this was just a rumour before the premiere I laughed at it and said if they did it, the film would become the laughing stock of everyone. But it appeared to be true!
