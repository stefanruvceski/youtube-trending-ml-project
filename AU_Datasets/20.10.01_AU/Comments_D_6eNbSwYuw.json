It took them one hour to arrive and nearly 2 and a half!!!! hour to arrive at the hospital (because of traffic(I was there before them)). They told him he has to wait for sure more then an hour because there are a lot of emergency cases today. He waited patiently even under big pain. He was laying and I noticed his belly looked a little &quot;pregnant&quot; like very filled. I told the doctors roaming around and they brought him to an room. The doctor was sitting on his computer (not caring about him at all) telling us that he has to wait for his documents arriving from the counter. At this moment my brother looked nearly dead to me ( very pale and a stare face so I was very worried). Finally they checked him and the saw that his spleen was burst open and he had more than 3 liters of blood already in his belly (that is why he looked so &quot;pregnant&quot;). Immediately 3 doctors rushed to him and gave him (all in all) 7 bloodtransfusions and the told us he had to get his spleen removed. All in all did they set him up for the surgery 8 times but changed there mind always in last minute (because it is very bad for your immune system to loose your spleen). All in all he stayed 2 Weeks in Hospital and gladly had no surgery just lots of lots of painkillers and other infusions and stuff. I just want to say that he is 12!!! years old and a very tough guy. He didn&#39;t scream or something and was very patient even EVERYBODY saw his pain and his full belly expect the nurses...<br />I am so glad they didn&#39;t operate him but how they treated him at the beginning was very  heartbreaking to see that at the beginning (they were extremely kind after that). So Please never say you know someone is faking something (even if you are not a doctor) you never know their true story.", "textOriginal": "I have a bad story about my brother who went skiing and the people from the ambulance and even the doctors thought he was faking it. We went skiing and he missed a turn an ran into a tree. He was skiing little bit more but felt big pain in his Belly. He got sick and pale and had to vomit so we called an ambulance. It took them one hour to arrive and nearly 2 and a half!!!! hour to arrive at the hospital (because of traffic(I was there before them)). They told him he has to wait for sure more then an hour because there are a lot of emergency cases today. He waited patiently even under big pain. He was laying and I noticed his belly looked a little \"pregnant\" like very filled. I told the doctors roaming around and they brought him to an room. The doctor was sitting on his computer (not caring about him at all) telling us that he has to wait for his documents arriving from the counter. At this moment my brother looked nearly dead to me ( very pale and a stare face so I was very worried). Finally they checked him and the saw that his spleen was burst open and he had more than 3 liters of blood already in his belly (that is why he looked so \"pregnant\"). Immediately 3 doctors rushed to him and gave him (all in all) 7 bloodtransfusions and the told us he had to get his spleen removed. All in all did they set him up for the surgery 8 times but changed there mind always in last minute (because it is very bad for your immune system to loose your spleen). All in all he stayed 2 Weeks in Hospital and gladly had no surgery just lots of lots of painkillers and other infusions and stuff. I just want to say that he is 12!!! years old and a very tough guy. He didn't scream or something and was very patient even EVERYBODY saw his pain and his full belly expect the nurses...\nI am so glad they didn't operate him but how they treated him at the beginning was very  heartbreaking to see that at the beginning (they were extremely kind after that). So Please never say you know someone is faking something (even if you are not a doctor) you never know their true story.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-10T17:30:53.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-10T17:30:53.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/uty6lA9nXef__-ao6RGC2PTzjIs\"", "id": "UgwDpH0LJ573rQCQNHp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/c1qwXoX92Du8OSl9n7tM8sMEyQM\"", "id": "UgwDpH0LJ573rQCQNHp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "diellgi", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79G-JkqWg_J8E9M7uIu9Efrg4k_WSDp22MlAg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn8NS3FgpBObfXRiJAN2NRw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCn8NS3FgpBObfXRiJAN2NRw"}, "videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "textDisplay": "A friend of mine who was 23 died from a heart attack .", "textOriginal": "A friend of mine who was 23 died from a heart attack .", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-10T17:28:19.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-10T17:28:19.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/SbgJ6S7FmubACIT2EmxogLaA6gI\"", "id": "UgyVpVVT8ODdYuPncjd4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/1EzH9ytXsYATikWkY2hpRqNhN3s\"", "id": "UgyVpVVT8ODdYuPncjd4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Tobs Ibz", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-bStXdbJxjqKerOtZPxx22lPjKJHMcLAcwPA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfDYqImr8HnfANPakrMVGxQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfDYqImr8HnfANPakrMVGxQ"}, "videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "textDisplay": "He doesn\u2019t have over 9 million subscribers", "textOriginal": "He doesn\u2019t have over 9 million subscribers", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-10T17:27:58.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-10T17:27:58.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/hhxLGPmVRxy3jOFAYpmho7GoHhs\"", "id": "UgwCBru9w49AyzE1oE54AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/feotrKeol6OK74uA837bIjbrfeM\"", "id": "UgwCBru9w49AyzE1oE54AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "haben1999", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-n4rm2mjZ3ywa6k9pWg13DSchy7tDX6IRRWw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7jDWzT1CuW1tRxjFwQgb1w", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7jDWzT1CuW1tRxjFwQgb1w"}, "videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "textDisplay": "\u201cCould be cocaine\u201d okay cocaine use is a risk factor for heart attacks though what was going through her mind", "textOriginal": "\u201cCould be cocaine\u201d okay cocaine use is a risk factor for heart attacks though what was going through her mind", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 3, "publishedAt": "2020-01-10T17:27:57.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-10T17:27:57.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/Ug9cBvARxjrPox_X_MYUcF5Qc-Y\"", "id": "UgxFdnDoISEcQD3J6QR4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"OOFf3Zw2jDbxxHsjJ3l8u1U8dz4/wzV_lSk3pd6ZjBH-QUcJyhxe-qc\"", "id": "UgxFdnDoISEcQD3J6QR4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "ThatOneEggplant", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-KaA2R4EmhLiS9hdCah-DRXW-rz4SHLNhsdg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-fnYs0osawkSee4gRWu3Iw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-fnYs0osawkSee4gRWu3Iw"}, "videoId": "D_6eNbSwYuw", "textDisplay": "I had a panic attack in my sleep and woke up to it.
