When I was 7 I went to the eye doctor because I couldnt see at school. Eye doc said I was faking. After a year of not being able to learn well in class, mom took me to another doctor. My eyesight was terrible, doctor asked why I didn&#39;t have glasses...<br /><br />When I was 11/12 I had migraines that were not that bad, for some reason they went away after about a year. When I was 18 I was suffering from migraines again. At first it wasn&#39;t that bad but eventually I had them almost every day. During a particularly bad week I went to the ER because I couldn&#39;t do anything because of how intense the pain was. ER neurologist said it was impossible to be feeling that much pain because &quot;there was nothing wrong with me&quot;. He gave me something for the pain and said &quot;this should make you sleep for a few hours&quot;. Pain got a lot better after a bit, fell asleep, woke up 10 minutes later crying in pain again. The experience of that doctor not believing me made me think that I shouldn&#39;t get treatment... I suffered by myself with migraines until I was 23.
