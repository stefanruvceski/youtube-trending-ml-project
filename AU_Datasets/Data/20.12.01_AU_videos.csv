Today I'm going to be customizing 3 different iphone cases. I'm painting on phone cases with acrylic paint, using some different styles and techniques including abstract design and semi-realism. Hope you like rainbows, cute animals (or demon animals), fruit and desserts!It's been a trend recently to paint directly on the iphone, but I think I'm going to stick with the cases for now 😂 I really want to learn more about how to customize different items and how to make painted surfaces more practical for everyday use. So if any of you have any knowledge of what kind of techniques or products I can use to prep different painting surfaces, please let me know!Also, if you guys really love any of the phone case designs, I could work on getting the design printed on actual phone cases to put in my shop!

Meet Harley Quinn, Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain. #BirdsOfPrey in theaters 2.7.20. https://www.facebook.com/BirdsOfPreyMovie https://twitter.com/birdsofpreywb https://www.instagram.com/BirdsOfPrey/ https://www.birdsofpreymovie.com/  You ever hear the one about the cop, the songbird, the psycho and the mafia princess?  “Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)” is a twisted tale told by Harley herself, as only Harley can tell it.  When Gotham’s most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.  Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya’s paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.  In the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Margot Robbie (“I, Tonya”) returns as Harley Quinn, alongside Mary Elizabeth Winstead (“10 Cloverfield Lane,” TV’s “Fargo”) as Huntress; Jurnee Smollett-Bell (HBO’s “True Blood”) as Black Canary; Rosie Perez (“Fearless,” “Pitch Perfect 2”) as Renee Montoya; Chris Messina (“Argo,” TV’s “Sharp Objects”) as Victor Zsasz; and Ewan McGregor (upcoming “Doctor Sleep,” the “Trainspotting” films) as Roman Sionis.  Newcomer Ella Jay Basco also stars as Cassandra “Cass” Cain in her feature film debut. Directed by Cathy Yan (“Dead Pigs”) from a script by Christina Hodson (“Bumblebee”), the film is based on characters from DC.  Robbie also produced, alongside Bryan Unkeless and Sue Kroll.  The film’s executive producers are Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, Geoff Johns, Hans Ritter and David Ayer. Joining Yan behind the scenes was a creative team comprised of director of photography Matthew Libatique (“A Star Is Born,” “Venom”); production designer K.K. Barrett (“Her”); editor Jay Cassidy (“American Hustle,” “Silver Linings Playbook”) and editor Evan Schiff (“John Wick Chapters 2 & 3”); and costume designer Erin Benach (“A Star Is Born”).  The music is by Daniel Pemberton (“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”). Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a LuckyChap Entertainment Production, a Clubhouse Pictures Production, a Kroll & Co. Entertainment Production, “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).”  Opening in theaters and IMAX nationwide on February 7, 2020, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures."

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb"

Is the wrap worth the cost? We bought two identical 350Zs and have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track. James Pumphrey and Zach Jobe are on Team Hi, and their car gets the expensive parts. Nolan Sykes and Aaron Parker are on team Low. Their car gets the cheap ones.Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on.If you want to “paint” or change the color of your car, you basically have three options- A traditional paint job, a vinyl wrap, or plastidip. The gloss of a paint job is intoxicating, but a perfect paint job like that is not only ridonkulously expensive, but it takes forever. There is so much prep work involved with a paint job like!So Hi Team is taking the happy medium route: they're getting Hi Car professionally vinyl wrapped. $2600 bucks. A quality wrap job is the best of every world. Hardly any prep work. It only takes a few days to get one done, though if you’re doing it yourself, put your patience-pants on. It protects your paint --if it’s worth protecting, it’s totally reversible --for when you change your mind, and you can have any sort of graphic screen printed onto a vinyl wrap. Team Low will be plastidipping their car by hand. Plasti dip offers many of the same benefits as vinyl-wrapping, but for a fraction of the price. We bought this plasti dip kit from “dip your car” for $500. It is California compliant, so that might make it worse. But on the bright side, it is relatively easy to do yourself (or so Nolan thought), there’s very little prep work, it’s totally reversible, and it’s easy to fix damage or mistakes. The only downsides are that it’s never going to look like a great paint job, it’s not that durable, and Team Low has to do it themselvesDoes it look $2000 better?

But his speech set me over the edge.When he thanked his wife there wasn’t a dry eye in the audience or at home. You have to see it for yourself.I mean, my heart can’t take it! And neither could fans on Twitter.One person said quote, “HARD TO NOT CRY WHEN TOM HANKS CRIES.”And another said quote, “I MEAN. WOW. #TomHanks is a worldwide treasure and we need to protect him at all costs. Also, excuse me while I wipe up the entire lake of tears I shed during his speech. @tomhanks”BRB still crying over this entire moment.And if that wasn’t enough to make you shed a tear, let’s talk about Kate McKinnon presenting Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award.She opened up about how Ellen made her feel comfortable with her sexuality and how she’s paved the way for many people in the LGBTQ+ community in Hollywood.And fans are really connecting with this moment as well.One person tweeted saying quote, “I became super emotional watching Ellen DeGeneres--that people sought to dim her light is unacceptable. All I can say is, Equality is non-negotiable. And @RepHartzler --your discriminatory + hateful views on the LGBTQ+ community have no place in Congress.”And another said quote, “It was amazing, and so was Kate Mckinnon’s introduction. It was just what I needed today. The world needs more Ellen’s.”And we couldn’t agree more!The last emotional moment we will talk about for today, because I don’t want you all crying too much, is Jennifer Anniston talking about the Australian fires.Many celebs brought attention to the tragic fires that are currently happening in Australia.Jenn read Russell Crowe’s acceptance speech for him because he is back home in Australia helping his family affected by the fires.She got choked up when reading it and fans talked about this moment on Twitter.One fan tweeted saying quote, “No, YOU were getting emotional watching Jennifer Aniston fighting off tears reading Russell Crowe's acceptance speech on the Australia fires.”And another said quote, “Jennifer Aniston did a superb job hosting and reading out Russel Crowe’s message with sincerity and empathy”And we totally get it. The fires are tragic and we’d like to help however we can.In our description we’ve linked some ways to donate and get involved. Please consider donating if you are able to!And I want to hear from you all which moment made you cry the most.Was it Tom Hanks or Kate McKinnon or someone else?Let me know down in the comments below.After that, why don’t you dive in to more Clevver News by hitting that subscribe button and click that bell so you don’t miss any of our new stories.

In 2020 TaylorMade Golf are releasing 3 new drivers the TaylorMade SIM driver, the TaylorMade SIM Max and The TaylorMade SIM Max D type driver. Rick Shiels heads to the driving range, the golf course and to Quest Golf Academy to test the drivers and see if they do actually hit the golf ball longer, hit the golf ball straight and help swing the golf club faster. Rick tests the driver using Titleist PRO V1 golf balls and Foresight GC Quad. The TaylorMade Golf SIM driver and TaylorMade Golf SIM Max driver will be played by golfers on The European Tour, The PGA Tour as well as The Masters, The USPGA, The US Open and The Open. Some of the best golfers in the world such as Dustin Johnson, Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and John Rahm will be using the new drivers BUT are they actually any better than the TaylorMade Golf M5 driver?

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video."

She had the courage to share with us that she wants to pursue other career paths outside of music and has made the decision to move on from the band. Of course, none of us wanted her to leave but we will always support her and love her no matter where life takes her. We wish her well with all her ventures and we hope you guys will too. This has been a very difficult decision for all of us to process and we know it’ll be tough for you guys too but please be kind as we all move forward. We really appreciate your kindness during this time.The door will always be open for her if she ever wants to return. We love her as a sister first, and we always will. We remain very close to her as her family.We are grateful for the 10 years that we had with her in the band and we wish her the best in her new chapter of life.Rest assured that Cimorelli will continue in 2020 onward with the other 5 of us. 2019 was one of the best years ever for Cimorelli and we are so grateful we had Dani as a part of it. We will do our best to move forward and kick butt in our new format and we look forward to sharing many new projects with you all in 2020. We will be grieving right alongside all of you but will also do our best to uplift you guys along the way with our new projects.Love you guys and thank you for understanding.- Cimorelli"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil – but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Open Sourced is a year-long reporting project from Recode by Vox that goes deep into the closed ecosystems of data, privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.

This journey is about reuniting with your self through regular practice. Through the process of getting to know who you really are, you will find that you need not prioritize the where, or the what, as much. You just have to be brave enough to look inside and recognize who it is you see.The opportunity is to be who you are and recognize where you are, today.  The choice is to do it honestly and with kindness. In our first practice, we apply this to asana and open up to the postures serving as opportunities to make discoveries.

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned. This was the perfect start to 2020.#arsenal #nicolaspepe #mikelartetaFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.
