Jordan, Jamie Foxx, and Brie Larson star in #JustMercy, in cinemas January 23, 2020. Michael B. Jordan (‚ÄúBlack Panther,‚Äù ‚ÄúCreed,‚Äù ‚ÄúCreed II‚Äù) and Oscar winners Jamie Foxx(‚ÄúRay,‚Äù ‚ÄúBaby Driver,‚Äù ‚ÄúDjango: Unchained‚Äù) and Brie Larson (‚ÄúRoom,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Glass Castle,‚Äù ‚ÄúCaptainMarvel‚Äù) star in ‚ÄúJust Mercy,‚Äù an inspiring drama that brings one of the most important stories ofour time to the big screen.Award-winning filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton (‚ÄúThe Glass Castle,‚Äù ‚ÄúShort Term 12‚Äù)directed the film from a screenplay he co-wrote, based on the award-winning nonfiction bestsellerby Bryan Stevenson.A powerful and thought-provoking true story, ‚ÄúJust Mercy‚Äù follows young lawyer BryanStevenson (Jordan) and his history-making battle for justice. After graduating from Harvard, Bryanhad his pick of lucrative jobs. Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemnedor who were not afforded proper representation, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley(Larson). One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite apreponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony againsthim came from a criminal with a motive to lie. In the years that follow, Bryan becomes embroiledin a labyrinth of legal and political maneuverings and overt and unabashed racism as he fights forWalter, and others like him, with the odds‚Äîand the system‚Äîstacked against them.The main cast also includes Rob Morgan (‚ÄúMudbound‚Äù) as Herbert Richardson, a fellowprisoner who also sits on death row awaiting his fate; Tim Blake Nelson (‚ÄúWormwood‚Äù) as RalphMyers, whose pivotal testimony against Walter McMillian is called into question; Rafe Spall asTommy Chapman, the DA who is fighting to uphold Walter‚Äôs conviction and sentence; O‚ÄôSheaJackson Jr. (‚ÄúStraight Outta Compton‚Äù) as Anthony Ray Hinton, another wrongly convicted deathrow inmate whose cause is taken up by Bryan; and Karan Kendrick (‚ÄúThe Hate U Give‚Äù) as Walter‚Äôswife, Minnie McMillian, who stands by her husband.The film is produced by two-time Oscar nominee Gil Netter (‚ÄúLife of Pi,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Blind Side‚Äù),Asher Goldstein (‚ÄúShort Term 12‚Äù) and Michael B. Jordan. Bryan Stevenson, Mike Drake, Niija Kuykendall, Gabriel Hammond, Daniel Hammond, Scott Budnick, Jeff Skoll and Charles D. Kingserved as executive producers.Cretton co-wrote the screenplay with Andrew Lanham (‚ÄúThe Glass Castle‚Äù), based onStevenson‚Äôs book Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption. Published in 2014 by Spiegel &Grau, the book has spent more than 150 weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers List, andcounting. It was also named one of the year‚Äôs best books by a number of top publications,including TIME Magazine. For the book, Stevenson also won the Andrew Carnegie Medal forExcellence, an NAACP Image Award, and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Nonfiction.Cretton‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Brett Pawlak,production designer Sharon Seymour, editor Nat Sanders and composer Joel P. West, all of whompreviously collaborated with the director on ‚ÄúThe Glass Castle.‚Äù They are joined by costumedesigner Francine Jamison-Tanchuck (‚ÄúDetroit,‚Äù ‚ÄúRoman J.

I started by using a brick mold made of fired clay from a previous video and made bricks from clay. The bricks were allowed to dry and were then transported to my hut using a brick carrying harness I made from cane and a piece of wood. They were dry stacked onto the wall of the hut to keep them out of the rain while waiting to be fired. I then constructed a brick kiln using mud as a mortar for adhering the bricks together. The kiln had 2 fireboxes side by side and was of the updraft kiln type. The kiln was open at the front and back so it could be stoked from these areas. This gave a more consistent firing I found then a kiln only with firebox opening at the front. I put 40 un-fired bricks into the kiln and fired them for 2 hours 30 minutes. All the bricks were fired sufficiently. I then tested an un-fired brick and a fired one by putting them in water. The un-fired brick dissolved quickly while the fired one survived completely intact. The test was a success. My only issue is the bricks are a little weak due to the clay they're made of. I'll look at refining clay or finding a better source somewhere in this area. About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
