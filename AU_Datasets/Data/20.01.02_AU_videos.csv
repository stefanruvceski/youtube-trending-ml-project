Japan has begun repatriating its citizens, and the US and South Korea are working to move their citizens out of China. More cases of the virus have been confirmed in China. Australia says its citizens who are being brought home from China will be quarantined offshore on Christmas Island at first.

Sockie's wish has one chance of coming true. Sockie's dream is to meet Gordon Ramsay. Gordon Ramsay is in Australia on a business trip and has decided to donate a prize to raise money for the Australian Bushfires. Whoever bids the most will win a lunch meal with Gordon Ramsay. It's Sockie Norris' only chance to make her dream come true and in this video we see what happens inside the Norris Nuts family as they decide how to approach this amazing once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. There will be an auction for the prize to have a dinner with Gordon Ramsay. The Norris Nuts decide if they are going to bid for Sockie and how much money to bid as it will all be donated to a great cause to help families in Australia who have lost their homes in the Australian bush fires in 2020.

Today I am doing a 24 hour challenge AGAIN. BUT, this time, I wanted to make it a little more interesting. I am not too big on challenges on my channel, just because I can't compete with the extreme challenges that so many other youtubers are willing to do LOL. I just like painting on things üòÇ PLUS, I feel like a lot of challenges these days have gotten really pointless. But, this one is good haha. I decided to try  to paint and decorate different things for 24 hours. I have a lot of art supplies laying around my art room, just begging to be painted. But I don't often have the time to paint that much at a time. So this was a great opportunity to put a bunch of it to good use finally.I am going to be painting on a seashell, painting a pencil pouch, painting a rock, painting a squishy (mini squishy makeover lol), making a custom mug, decorating a giant clothes pin and a surprise weird item LOL.

Does more expensive mean more better? We‚Äôre gonna find out once and for all.Donut bought two identical Nissan 350z‚Äôs, and for the past few weeks have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track.Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) got a bunch of really cheap parts and in the end got  a slammed turbo z that shoots flames all for around $13,000.Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) on the other hand, got a bunch of really nice expensive stuff totaling an astounding $33,000.  Then we tested them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We‚Äôre gonna break down the cost of building these two cars, test them head to head on track, and decide which is better. Low Car got a set of eBay coilovers of unknown origin,  and Hi Car was treated to a set of KW V3s. Next, we installed wheels and tires. Hi Car got some sick Advan RGIII‚Äôs wrapped in Bridgestone RE71s. Meanwhile on the Low Car, We bought some XXR 527s, and decided to run Federal RS-RR tires. In the end, both cars were able to achieve supercar-level braking distance by switching to super sticky rubber. Nolan and Aaron installed more aggressive brake pads, steel braided brake lines, flushed and replaced the brake fluid, and bled the lines. Over on Hi Car, Zach and James replaced the car‚Äôs entire braking system with a 6 piston, 13 brake kit from Wilwood. After that we went inside our Zs, installing racing seats. The Hi Car got two Sparco QRT-R seats, a Greddy steering wheel, and a hub to make it removable. Lo Car received some Corbeau DFXs racing seats.Next, both cars were fitted with modified differentials to make sick skids easier. Hi Car got a very trick Kaaz 2-way differential. Zach spent a lot of time adjusting the spacing, making sure it was perfect. Over on Lo Car we took a different route. Instead of installing a new differential, we welded ours together!After making a bunch of performance upgrades, it was time to alter the looks of our beloved Zs. Team Low decided to give Lo Car some plastidip.Over on team Hi, they took their car to a professional vinyl shop.Finally, we gave the Donut Zs some BOOST! Hi car got a Jim Wolf  twin turbo setup that made it sound like a Baby GTR. And the low car got a single turbo kit by way of eBay.Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!‚ñ∫Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.
