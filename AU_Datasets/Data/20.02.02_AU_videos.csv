To save 20%, enter MORIAH at checkout ‚Äì‚Äìhttp://bit.ly/HUM_moriahSo today is a weird video. I've had this video planned for SUCH a long time LOL. I bought the book back in June, and I've been waiting for just the right occasion. Also, I needed time to collect the hair off my cat haha. I ended up not needed that much...I have quite a bit of fur left over. So if anyone needs a buttload of coffee colored cat hair, I gotcha covered üòÇ I did have fun making this very weird cat themed craft. It's been awhile since I've straight-up crafted at all, so I guess making cat finger puppets was the perfect way to come back? If you're ever bored and want to make some unique crafts with supplies you have at home (if you have a cat), then I recommend trying this. Then give away your cat hair projects as gifts...your family and friends will loooove them and definitely not be weirded out at all. üòù THIS IS THE LAST DAY TO ORDER PICKLE THE DINOSAUR. He is an exclusive collector's item and will be very rare and difficult to find after today.ORDER HERE: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/SimplyNailogical's Cat Hair Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hKjVRYmrRkIn case you want to craft with your own cat:The Crafting With Cat Hair Book: https://amzn.to/2uNF2gW*affiliate link*___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Japan has begun repatriating its citizens, and the US and South Korea are working to move their citizens out of China. More cases of the virus have been confirmed in China.

Sockie's wish has one chance of coming true. Sockie's dream is to meet Gordon Ramsay. Gordon Ramsay is in Australia on a business trip and has decided to donate a prize to raise money for the Australian Bushfires. Whoever bids the most will win a lunch meal with Gordon Ramsay. It's Sockie Norris' only chance to make her dream come true and in this video we see what happens inside the Norris Nuts family as they decide how to approach this amazing once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. There will be an auction for the prize to have a dinner with Gordon Ramsay. The Norris Nuts decide if they are going to bid for Sockie and how much money to bid as it will all be donated to a great cause to help families in Australia who have lost their homes in the Australian bush fires in 2020.

As fascinating as it is when an archaeologist pulls something out of the ground and is immediately able to tell us all about what it is, and what it says about the people who came before us, we're much more excited when they come across something they can't explain. Even with all our current technology, the amount of information we're missing about our ancestors and the way they lived is startling. Perhaps we'd understand them a little better if we correctly understood the purpose of the strange artifacts you're about to see in this video!For all questions contact us at: amazingstockchannel@gmail.com"

Does more expensive mean more better? We‚Äôre gonna find out once and for all.Donut bought two identical Nissan 350z‚Äôs, and for the past few weeks have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track.Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) got a bunch of really cheap parts and in the end got  a slammed turbo z that shoots flames all for around $13,000.Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) on the other hand, got a bunch of really nice expensive stuff totaling an astounding $33,000.  Then we tested them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We‚Äôre gonna break down the cost of building these two cars, test them head to head on track, and decide which is better. Low Car got a set of eBay coilovers of unknown origin,  and Hi Car was treated to a set of KW V3s. Next, we installed wheels and tires. Hi Car got some sick Advan RGIII‚Äôs wrapped in Bridgestone RE71s. Meanwhile on the Low Car, We bought some XXR 527s, and decided to run Federal RS-RR tires. In the end, both cars were able to achieve supercar-level braking distance by switching to super sticky rubber. Nolan and Aaron installed more aggressive brake pads, steel braided brake lines, flushed and replaced the brake fluid, and bled the lines. Over on Hi Car, Zach and James replaced the car‚Äôs entire braking system with a 6 piston, 13 brake kit from Wilwood. After that we went inside our Zs, installing racing seats. The Hi Car got two Sparco QRT-R seats, a Greddy steering wheel, and a hub to make it removable. Lo Car received some Corbeau DFXs racing seats.Next, both cars were fitted with modified differentials to make sick skids easier. Hi Car got a very trick Kaaz 2-way differential. Zach spent a lot of time adjusting the spacing, making sure it was perfect. Over on Lo Car we took a different route. Instead of installing a new differential, we welded ours together!After making a bunch of performance upgrades, it was time to alter the looks of our beloved Zs. Team Low decided to give Lo Car some plastidip.Over on team Hi, they took their car to a professional vinyl shop.Finally, we gave the Donut Zs some BOOST! Hi car got a Jim Wolf  twin turbo setup that made it sound like a Baby GTR. And the low car got a single turbo kit by way of eBay.Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!‚ñ∫Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.
