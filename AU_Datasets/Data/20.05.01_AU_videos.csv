Of course, none of us wanted her to leave but we will always support her and love her no matter where life takes her. We wish her well with all her ventures and we hope you guys will too. This has been a very difficult decision for all of us to process and we know it’ll be tough for you guys too but please be kind as we all move forward. We really appreciate your kindness during this time.The door will always be open for her if she ever wants to return. We love her as a sister first, and we always will. We remain very close to her as her family.We are grateful for the 10 years that we had with her in the band and we wish her the best in her new chapter of life.Rest assured that Cimorelli will continue in 2020 onward with the other 5 of us. 2019 was one of the best years ever for Cimorelli and we are so grateful we had Dani as a part of it. We will do our best to move forward and kick butt in our new format and we look forward to sharing many new projects with you all in 2020. We will be grieving right alongside all of you but will also do our best to uplift you guys along the way with our new projects.Love you guys and thank you for understanding.- Cimorelli"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong.

This journey is about reuniting with your self through regular practice. Through the process of getting to know who you really are, you will find that you need not prioritize the where, or the what, as much. You just have to be brave enough to look inside and recognize who it is you see.The opportunity is to be who you are and recognize where you are, today.  The choice is to do it honestly and with kindness. In our first practice, we apply this to asana and open up to the postures serving as opportunities to make discoveries.

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned. This was the perfect start to 2020.#arsenal #nicolaspepe #mikelartetaFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn’t do much about it.Unless… we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, Имяя Фамилияя, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, Máté Szabó, Kasper Kylmälä, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"
