Hundreds of millions of people have viewed social media posts about Dr Li Wen-Liang who's died after contracting the illness, while treating infected patients. He was censored by the authorities in the city of Wuhan, after raising the alarm back in December about the potential dangers of the new virus. The government has now sent officials to investigate how he was treated. As the coronavirus continues to spread, controls and restrictions are increasing right across China, where more than six hundred people have died, and another thirty one thousand have been infected.   A British man on his honeymoon is among more than sixty people, who've tested positive for the virus on board a cruise ship in Japan.  Alan Steele from Wolverhampton has been taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.  Of the 3700 people on board the 'Diamond Princess,' it is thought there are around eighty Britons, with the ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan. All the passengers have been confined to their cabins, for the next fortnight. Tonight's BBC News at Ten is presented by Clive Myrie and he hears from the BBC's China correspondent Jon Sudworth in Beijing, the BBC‚Äôs Medical Correspondent, Fergus Walsh and the BBC‚Äôs Health Editor Hugh Pym."

By comparison, he added, just $18 million was spent on preparedness in Congo‚Äôs neighbor Uganda before the virus crossed the border.‚ÄúThis must be a lesson for the rest of the world,‚Äù he said.The plea from WHO‚Äôs top official comes as the deadly coronavirus has now killed at least 362 people and sickened more than 17,400 worldwide, including patients in the U.S. and Europe.The respiratory illness, which is capable of spreading through human-to-human contact, is not yet considered a pandemic. A pandemic is ‚Äúan epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people,‚Äù according to WHO. While the new virus has spread to almost two dozen countries, the majority of the cases remain in mainland China.Nevertheless, many global health experts expect the virus will become a pandemic. Since emerging about a month ago in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus has infected more people than the 2003 SARS epidemic, which sickened roughly 8,100 people across the globe over nine months. As of Monday, there are nearly 200 cases in at least 23 countries, outside of China, a handful of which have been transmitted from human contact within those countries.On Thursday, WHO declared the virus a global health emergency after declining to do so at two previous meetings.Tedros said the ‚Äúcontinued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China‚Äù were ‚Äúmost deeply disturbing.‚ÄùFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC¬ª Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend, Samantha VincentNo matter how fast you are, no one outruns their past. Summer 2020 is the time for F9, the ninth chapter in the saga that has endured for almost two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  Vin Diesel‚Äôs Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he‚Äôs going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they‚Äôve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom‚Äôs forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, next year‚Äôs The Suicide Squad). F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe‚Äîfrom London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tblisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom‚Äôs past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent."
