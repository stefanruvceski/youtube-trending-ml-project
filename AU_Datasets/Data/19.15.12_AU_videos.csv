After graduating from Harvard, Bryanhad his pick of lucrative jobs. Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemnedor who were not afforded proper representation, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley(Larson). One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite apreponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony againsthim came from a criminal with a motive to lie. In the years that follow, Bryan becomes embroiledin a labyrinth of legal and political maneuverings and overt and unabashed racism as he fights forWalter, and others like him, with the odds‚Äîand the system‚Äîstacked against them.The main cast also includes Rob Morgan (‚ÄúMudbound‚Äù) as Herbert Richardson, a fellowprisoner who also sits on death row awaiting his fate; Tim Blake Nelson (‚ÄúWormwood‚Äù) as RalphMyers, whose pivotal testimony against Walter McMillian is called into question; Rafe Spall asTommy Chapman, the DA who is fighting to uphold Walter‚Äôs conviction and sentence; O‚ÄôSheaJackson Jr. (‚ÄúStraight Outta Compton‚Äù) as Anthony Ray Hinton, another wrongly convicted deathrow inmate whose cause is taken up by Bryan; and Karan Kendrick (‚ÄúThe Hate U Give‚Äù) as Walter‚Äôswife, Minnie McMillian, who stands by her husband.The film is produced by two-time Oscar nominee Gil Netter (‚ÄúLife of Pi,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Blind Side‚Äù),Asher Goldstein (‚ÄúShort Term 12‚Äù) and Michael B. Jordan. Bryan Stevenson, Mike Drake, Niija Kuykendall, Gabriel Hammond, Daniel Hammond, Scott Budnick, Jeff Skoll and Charles D. Kingserved as executive producers.Cretton co-wrote the screenplay with Andrew Lanham (‚ÄúThe Glass Castle‚Äù), based onStevenson‚Äôs book Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption. Published in 2014 by Spiegel &Grau, the book has spent more than 150 weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers List, andcounting. It was also named one of the year‚Äôs best books by a number of top publications,including TIME Magazine. For the book, Stevenson also won the Andrew Carnegie Medal forExcellence, an NAACP Image Award, and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Nonfiction.Cretton‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Brett Pawlak,production designer Sharon Seymour, editor Nat Sanders and composer Joel P. West, all of whompreviously collaborated with the director on ‚ÄúThe Glass Castle.‚Äù They are joined by costumedesigner Francine Jamison-Tanchuck (‚ÄúDetroit,‚Äù ‚ÄúRoman J.

Today I am revisiting my shrink plastic obsession (or shrinky dinks. ehhhh) and making 12 different food/animal themed DIY custom pins. I hope you gys are into this, because I looooove making these things, it's so much fun!! This is pretty easy to do, but there are a lot of steps, and it can be a bit time consuming. But, if you're looking for an awesome craft that involves drawing, you've got it. These are super cute in the end and create such a cool collection to display on pin boards, bags or clothing.RAINBOW PICKLE SHIRT: NO LONGER AVAILABLE.ENAMEL PINS:https://me-merch.myshopify.com/collections/hard-enamel-pinsMATERIALS FOR THIS PROJECT *contains affiliate links*:Shrink Plastic: https://amzn.to/35KHT7yPosca Paint Pens: https://amzn.to/2Y3wcX4Dimensional Magic: https://amzn.to/37LpMjzMini Oven?

I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).
