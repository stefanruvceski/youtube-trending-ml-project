Vin Diesel‚Äôs Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he‚Äôs going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they‚Äôve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom‚Äôs forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, next year‚Äôs The Suicide Squad). F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe‚Äîfrom London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tblisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom‚Äôs past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent."

To save 20%, enter MORIAH at checkout ‚Äì‚Äìhttp://bit.ly/HUM_moriahSo today is a weird video. I've had this video planned for SUCH a long time LOL. I bought the book back in June, and I've been waiting for just the right occasion. Also, I needed time to collect the hair off my cat haha. I ended up not needed that much...I have quite a bit of fur left over. So if anyone needs a buttload of coffee colored cat hair, I gotcha covered üòÇ I did have fun making this very weird cat themed craft. It's been awhile since I've straight-up crafted at all, so I guess making cat finger puppets was the perfect way to come back? If you're ever bored and want to make some unique crafts with supplies you have at home (if you have a cat), then I recommend trying this. Then give away your cat hair projects as gifts...your family and friends will loooove them and definitely not be weirded out at all. üòù THIS IS THE LAST DAY TO ORDER PICKLE THE DINOSAUR.

I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Which movie's sins should we expose next?!Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CinemaSins Podcast: https://soundcloud.com/cinemasins TVSins: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe4bOvc1mYxFcQ5xPb9Zmow MusicVideoSins: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBq8oBRVTsMpjWiHfjJpDw Twitters...Jeremy: http://twitter.com/cinemasins Barrett: http://twitter.com/musicvideosins Aaron: http://twitter.com/aarondicer Jonathan: http://twitter.com/samloomis13 Denee: http://twitter.com/deneesaysMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/cinemasins-storeSubreddit: http://reddit.com/r/cinemasins Website: http://cinemasins.com SinCast Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/SinCastCinemaSins#CinemaSins#EverythingWrongWith#Joker"

The virus has now spread to India and Philippines. Thousands of people have been infected worldwide, the vast majority of them in China. Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Japan has begun repatriating its citizens, and the US and South Korea are working to move their citizens out of China. More cases of the virus have been confirmed in China. Australia says its citizens who are being brought home from China will be quarantined offshore on Christmas Island at first. Some airlines, including British Airways, have suspended all flights to and from China. In Germany, three new cases have been reported. Meanwhile, scientists are working feverishly to develop a vaccine.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dw_stories/F√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#Coronavirus #India #ChinaCoronavirus"

Sockie's wish has one chance of coming true. Sockie's dream is to meet Gordon Ramsay. Gordon Ramsay is in Australia on a business trip and has decided to donate a prize to raise money for the Australian Bushfires. Whoever bids the most will win a lunch meal with Gordon Ramsay. It's Sockie Norris' only chance to make her dream come true and in this video we see what happens inside the Norris Nuts family as they decide how to approach this amazing once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. There will be an auction for the prize to have a dinner with Gordon Ramsay. The Norris Nuts decide if they are going to bid for Sockie and how much money to bid as it will all be donated to a great cause to help families in Australia who have lost their homes in the Australian bush fires in 2020.

How prepared would we be to deal with a global pandemic? Subscribe to our channel here: https://goo.gl/31Q53FCases of Coronavirus have now been confirmed in Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, the US and France, after the virus began in China. In a globalised world, how might such an outbreak be contained?We‚Äôve had similar scares before, with SARS in 2003, bird flu in 2006, swine flu in 2009, and even Ebola and Zika. What are the plans in place to act against a major threat?  The World Health Organization has said it's too early to term the outbreak of coronavirus an international public health emergency. It also doesn't fulfil the criteria for a pandemic, which is a spread worldwide of a new disease. Ben Chu reports, and Katie speaks to Tom Inglesby, Director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Sarah Gilbert, Professor of Vaccinology at Oxford University.Newsnight is the BBC's flagship news and current affairs TV programme - with analysis, debate, exclusives, and robust interviews. Website: https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsnightTwitter: https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnightFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsnight"

Even with all our current technology, the amount of information we're missing about our ancestors and the way they lived is startling.
