This test, which does not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, is intended to demonstrate Crew Dragon’s ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. The six-hour test window opens at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC. A backup opportunity with the same six-hour launch window opening at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC, is available on Monday, January 20. Current weather data suggests our best opportunity for the launch escape test will be towards the end of the four-hour window, but we will continue to provide updates as new data becomes available."

Spenser (Mark Wahlberg) — an ex-cop better known for making trouble than solving it — just got out of prison and is leaving Boston for good. But first he gets roped into helping his old boxing coach and mentor, Henry (Alan Arkin), with a promising amateur. That's Hawk (Winston Duke), a brash, no-nonsense MMA fighter convinced he'll be a tougher opponent than Spenser ever was. When two of Spenser’s former colleagues turn up murdered, he recruits Hawk and his foul-mouthed ex-girlfriend, Cissy (Iliza Shlesinger), to help him investigate and bring the culprits to justice. From director Peter Berg, SPENSER CONFIDENTIAL is an action-comedy co-starring Bokeem Woodbine, Marc Maron, and Post Malone. Inspired by Robert B. Parker’s Wonderland, a best-selling novel by Ace Atkins.

This is Australia’s real life Baywatch! Taking the viewers on their journey through mass rescues, drownings, resuscitations, shark sightings, and all number of the weird and wonderful experiences Bondi Beach dishes up. In ‘Bondi Rescue’ the audience sees the action through the eyes of real characters and lifeguards like Hoppo, Deano, Reidy, Jesse, Maxy, Whippet and Harries, as they catch thieves, perform CPR, make drug busts, break up fights, and even handle a navy bomb that washes ashore one afternoon. Every year throws up new and completely unexpected challenges, and how lifeguards adapt is what makes Bondi Rescue a show that’s about much more than swimmers being saved in the surf.Best Rescues - http://bit.ly/bestrescuesClose Calls and Near Deaths - https://bit.ly/2RBd3Z1Worst Injuries - http://bit.ly/worstinjuriesHilarious Moments - http://bit.ly/hilariouseventsBest Goofs - http://bit.ly/bestgoofBondi’s Lifeguards - http://bit.ly/bondilifeguardsSaving Kids - http://bit.ly/lostonbeachThieves and Perverts - http://bit.ly/thievesandpervertsCrazy Animal Encounters - http://bit.ly/bondicrazyanimalsFamous People - http://bit.ly/famouspeopleFACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/BondiRescueTVINSTAGRAM - https://www.instagram.com/bondirescuetv/TWITTER - https://twitter.com/bondirescueITUNES - http://ow.ly/aDVRz WEBSITE - http://www.cjz.com.auMERCH STORE - https://teespring.com/stores/bondi-rescue"

Oh, and just to be clear, a character just being intimidating isn’t enough here. So, Terence Fletcher from “Whiplash” and Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from “Full Metal Jacket” - haa, you can’t get us! At least, for now. Our countdown includes films such as “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” (2003), “Batman Returns” (1992) & “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991).

Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) get the expensive parts and Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) get the cheap ones. Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. If you want more power out of your Z, you really have to go forced induction. Which basically means, forcing more air into the engine to get more combustion. So in this episode we're installing turbochargers.Hi Team went with a Jim Wolf Technologies twin turbo kit. It’s high quality across the board. Best materials, it’s been through lots of R&D, everything should bolt up easily. But it’s $8000 DOLLARS! That’s more than we paid for the actual car! Can that possibly be worth it?It comes with two Garrett GT25 turbos. Garrett is one of the most trusted brands of turbo. It also comes with all the piping, plumbing and pieces you could ever ask for. Sometimes with these kits, the plumbing won’t fit quite right so you’ll find yourself having to do fabrication or calling your friend who knows how to weld. But with this expensive kit, theoretically everything should bolt right up and we won’t have to get our Tinker Boyz on. Part of that $8000 price tag. It was designed to be an OEM+ set-up with OEM reliability in mind, which means it shouldn’t require a lot of attention from you once its in--another benefit. It comes with its’ own piggyback box which talks with the car’s ECU or computer, and the right one can save you a lot of time and effort.These turbos are good for up to 530 hp, which is beneficial in two ways. If you do choose to go FULL hot boi down the line, you won’t need to upgrade your turbos, you can just keep these. The other benefit is that because these are way more than what we’re going to be throwing at them, they’re not likely to be a failure point.Team Low went with a Rev9 turbo kit, purchased on Amazon for $2400. It’s a single turbo kit. It comes with a turbonetics 60-1 turbo and a turbonetics evolution 38mm external wastegate. That’s one of the reasons we chose this kit. The turbocharger itself is the part of any turbo kit that is the most likely to fail. So even though this kit is “cheap”, I know with a name-brand, at least the turbo itself should be fine.This kit only includes the hard parts and doesn’t come with any software to help tell the ECU what’s going on. So in addition to the kit, we also had to buy an UpRev software license.We’re gonna show you our super long journey to get these things installed, then we dyno them to see who makes more power!Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

One night, he makes the mistake of drunkenly dropping an inflammatory barb on a broadcast of Skizm, an illegal death-match fight club streamed live to the public. In response, Riktor (Ned Dennehy), the maniacal mastermind behind the channel, decides to force Miles' hand (or hands, as it were) and have him join the fun. Miles wakes to find heavy pistols bolted into his bones, and learns Nix (Samara Weaving), the trigger-happy star of Skizm, is his first opponent. Gleefully echoing elements of Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the Purge franchise, and videogames like Mortal Kombat, Guns Akimbo is hilariously dark, viciously violent, and potentially — chillingly — prescient. Director Jason Lei Howden (Deathgasm) foretells of a future that may soon await us: drone-captured live feeds, UFC-like competitions pushed to an extreme, and online streaming platforms used for gladiatorial entertainment all around the world. As Miles navigates the underworld of Skizm, the stakes — and the ratings — have never been higher. #GunsAkimbo #DanielRadcliffe #SamaraWeavingIn Cinemas March 5th 2020Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/madmanfilmsTwitter: http://twitter.com/madmanfilms Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/madmanfilms"

Called Tesla killer, Faraday’s meteoric rise in notoriety occurred on dubious underpinnings — the company did not promise a product, nor did it announce any concrete plans for its first few years of operation. The mystery surrounding Faraday was only matched by its enigmatic cofounder and CEO, Jia YT Yueting, the billionaire businessman who founded multiple telecom companies in China but left abruptly to become the CEO of Faraday. We took a look at YT and Faraday Future's promise, the financial woes that led them both to bankruptcy, and YT's relationship with the reanimated Faraday today.MORE CARS INSIDER:The Rise And Fall Of Hummerhttps://youtu.be/SHLmoswkkAQTesla Tuning Shop Upgrades Model X Into A $175,000 Masterpiecehttps://youtu.be/r3kvjBFLXz8Why Tesla's Model 3 Received A 5-Star Crash Test Ratinghttps://youtu.be/il2jmMRgFV8------------------------------------------------------#FaradayFuture #ElectricCar #BusinessInsiderBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.Visit us at: https://www.businessinsider.comSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsiderBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcjBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29TBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGFBI on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo--------------------------------------------------How The Man Who Challenged Tesla Went Bankrupt"

Oliver returned home to Starling City, bent on righting the wrongs of his family and fighting injustice. To do this, he created the persona of The Arrow and allied himself with former military man John Diggle, computer-science expert Felicity Smoak, lawyer-turned-vigilante Laurel Lance, billionaire inventor Ray Palmer, and his sister Thea Queen. After years of denying himself his own life as Oliver Queen in order to be The Arrow, Oliver left Starling City with Felicity and made a home in suburbia. But their newly tranquil lives are upended when an evil new organization, H.I.V.E., takes over the newly-christened Star City. Oliver is forced to don the hood once more…but can he keep his aim as The Arrow without losing the life he has fought so hard to get back?Connect with ARROW Online:Visit ARROW WEBSITE: http://www.cwtv.com/shows/arrowLike ARROW on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/cwarrowFollow ARROW on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/cw_arrowFollow ARROW on INSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/cw_arrowFollow ARROW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw/arrowFollow ARROW on TUMBLR: http://thecwarrow.tumblr.com#ArrowAbout The CW:Official YouTube Channel for The CW Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as Black Lightning, The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, The 100, Dynasty, In the Dark, and Roswell, New Mexico.Connect with The CW Online:Visit The CW WEBSITE: http://cwtv.comLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecwFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecwFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecwFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.comFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecwArrow | Season 8 Episode 9 | Green Arrow & The Canaries Promo | The CWhttps://www.youtube.com/TheCW"

Rick Shiels heads to the Quest Golf Academy to test the drivers and see if they do actually hit the golf ball longer, hit the golf ball straight and help swing the golf club faster. Rick tests the driver using Titleist PRO V1 golf balls and Foresight GC Quad. Rick then takes the Callaway Mavrik Driver on the course against the Callaway Epic Flash Driver from 2019 to see if the claim of gaining 5 more yards is actually true. The Callaway Mavrik Driver, Callaway Mavrik Subzero Driver and Callaway Mavrik Max Driver will be played by golfers on The European Tour, The PGA Tour as well as The Masters, The USPGA, The US Open and The Open. Some of the best golfers in the world such as Phil Mickelson, Xander Schauffelle, Danny Willett, Francesco Molinari and Henrik Stenson will be using the new drivers BUT are they actually any better than the Callaway Epic Flash?

So if any of you have any knowledge of what kind of techniques or products I can use to prep different painting surfaces, please let me know!Also, if you guys really love any of the phone case designs, I could work on getting the design printed on actual phone cases to put in my shop!

Meet Harley Quinn, Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain. #BirdsOfPrey in theaters 2.7.20. https://www.facebook.com/BirdsOfPreyMovie https://twitter.com/birdsofpreywb https://www.instagram.com/BirdsOfPrey/ https://www.birdsofpreymovie.com/  You ever hear the one about the cop, the songbird, the psycho and the mafia princess?  “Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)” is a twisted tale told by Harley herself, as only Harley can tell it.  When Gotham’s most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her.  Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya’s paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.  In the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Margot Robbie (“I, Tonya”) returns as Harley Quinn, alongside Mary Elizabeth Winstead (“10 Cloverfield Lane,” TV’s “Fargo”) as Huntress; Jurnee Smollett-Bell (HBO’s “True Blood”) as Black Canary; Rosie Perez (“Fearless,” “Pitch Perfect 2”) as Renee Montoya; Chris Messina (“Argo,” TV’s “Sharp Objects”) as Victor Zsasz; and Ewan McGregor (upcoming “Doctor Sleep,” the “Trainspotting” films) as Roman Sionis.  Newcomer Ella Jay Basco also stars as Cassandra “Cass” Cain in her feature film debut. Directed by Cathy Yan (“Dead Pigs”) from a script by Christina Hodson (“Bumblebee”), the film is based on characters from DC.  Robbie also produced, alongside Bryan Unkeless and Sue Kroll.  The film’s executive producers are Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, Geoff Johns, Hans Ritter and David Ayer. Joining Yan behind the scenes was a creative team comprised of director of photography Matthew Libatique (“A Star Is Born,” “Venom”); production designer K.K. Barrett (“Her”); editor Jay Cassidy (“American Hustle,” “Silver Linings Playbook”) and editor Evan Schiff (“John Wick Chapters 2 & 3”); and costume designer Erin Benach (“A Star Is Born”).  The music is by Daniel Pemberton (“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”). Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a LuckyChap Entertainment Production, a Clubhouse Pictures Production, a Kroll & Co. Entertainment Production, “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).”  Opening in theaters and IMAX nationwide on February 7, 2020, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures."

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s greatest humorists, was given at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. https://www.kennedy-center.org/pages/specialevents/marktwainDave Chappelle is an internationally recognized stand-up comedian and actor whose trademark wit and sharp, irreverent social commentary explores race, popular culture, sex, drugs, politics, and fame. Arguably the most-touring comic on the circuit, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 concerts worldwide in the past four years, selling out shows within minutes of their announcements.Dave Chappelle could always make people laugh. Once he realized the power of his natural talent, he set some ambitious goals for his art. As a 14-year-old student at Washington, D.C.'s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Chappelle crafted his stand-up comedy act out of the realities of his life growing up Black in the nation's capital.ABOUT THE MARK TWAIN PRIZEThe Mark Twain Prize recognizes people who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist and creator of memorable characters, Samuel Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled and outraged many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly. He revealed the great truth of humor when he said against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.The inaugural Mark Twain Prize was presented to Richard Pryor during the first annual Kennedy Center Celebration of American Humor, October 20, 1998. The event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber and is televised annually. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception. Previous recipients of the Mark Twain include Richard Pryor (1998), Jonathan Winters (1999), Carl Reiner (2000), Whoopi Goldberg (2001), Bob Newhart (2002), Lily Tomlin (2003), Lorne Michaels (2004), Steve Martin (2005), Neil Simon (2006), Billy Crystal (2007), George Carlin (2008), Bill Cosby (2009, rescinded in 2018) Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013) Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018). #MarkTwainPrize #DaveChappelle #MTPSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb"
