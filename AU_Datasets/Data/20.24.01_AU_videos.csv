Does more expensive mean more better? We’re gonna find out once and for all.Donut bought two identical Nissan 350z’s, and for the past few weeks have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track.Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) got a bunch of really cheap parts and in the end got  a slammed turbo z that shoots flames all for around $13,000.Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) on the other hand, got a bunch of really nice expensive stuff totaling an astounding $33,000.  Then we tested them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We’re gonna break down the cost of building these two cars, test them head to head on track, and decide which is better. Low Car got a set of eBay coilovers of unknown origin,  and Hi Car was treated to a set of KW V3s. Next, we installed wheels and tires. Hi Car got some sick Advan RGIII’s wrapped in Bridgestone RE71s. Meanwhile on the Low Car, We bought some XXR 527s, and decided to run Federal RS-RR tires. In the end, both cars were able to achieve supercar-level braking distance by switching to super sticky rubber. Nolan and Aaron installed more aggressive brake pads, steel braided brake lines, flushed and replaced the brake fluid, and bled the lines. Over on Hi Car, Zach and James replaced the car’s entire braking system with a 6 piston, 13 brake kit from Wilwood. After that we went inside our Zs, installing racing seats. The Hi Car got two Sparco QRT-R seats, a Greddy steering wheel, and a hub to make it removable. Lo Car received some Corbeau DFXs racing seats.Next, both cars were fitted with modified differentials to make sick skids easier. Hi Car got a very trick Kaaz 2-way differential. Zach spent a lot of time adjusting the spacing, making sure it was perfect. Over on Lo Car we took a different route. Instead of installing a new differential, we welded ours together!After making a bunch of performance upgrades, it was time to alter the looks of our beloved Zs. Team Low decided to give Lo Car some plastidip.Over on team Hi, they took their car to a professional vinyl shop.Finally, we gave the Donut Zs some BOOST! Hi car got a Jim Wolf  twin turbo setup that made it sound like a Baby GTR. And the low car got a single turbo kit by way of eBay.Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

This test, which does not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, is intended to demonstrate Crew Dragon’s ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. The six-hour test window opens at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC. A backup opportunity with the same six-hour launch window opening at 8:00 a.m. EST, or 13:00 UTC, is available on Monday, January 20. Current weather data suggests our best opportunity for the launch escape test will be towards the end of the four-hour window, but we will continue to provide updates as new data becomes available."

We’re talking about those characters that, for one reason or another, creep you out, but are not what most would traditionally class as scary. Oh, and just to be clear, a character just being intimidating isn’t enough here. So, Terence Fletcher from “Whiplash” and Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from “Full Metal Jacket” - haa, you can’t get us! At least, for now. Our countdown includes films such as “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” (2003), “Batman Returns” (1992) & “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991).

Limited tix available now: http://mad.mn/gunsakimbomonsterNerdy video game developer (Daniel Radcliffe) is a little too fond of stirring things up on the internet with his caustic, prodding, and antagonizing comments. One night, he makes the mistake of drunkenly dropping an inflammatory barb on a broadcast of Skizm, an illegal death-match fight club streamed live to the public. In response, Riktor (Ned Dennehy), the maniacal mastermind behind the channel, decides to force Miles' hand (or hands, as it were) and have him join the fun. Miles wakes to find heavy pistols bolted into his bones, and learns Nix (Samara Weaving), the trigger-happy star of Skizm, is his first opponent. Gleefully echoing elements of Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the Purge franchise, and videogames like Mortal Kombat, Guns Akimbo is hilariously dark, viciously violent, and potentially — chillingly — prescient. Director Jason Lei Howden (Deathgasm) foretells of a future that may soon await us: drone-captured live feeds, UFC-like competitions pushed to an extreme, and online streaming platforms used for gladiatorial entertainment all around the world. As Miles navigates the underworld of Skizm, the stakes — and the ratings — have never been higher. #GunsAkimbo #DanielRadcliffe #SamaraWeavingIn Cinemas March 5th 2020Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/madmanfilmsTwitter: http://twitter.com/madmanfilms Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/madmanfilms"

Called Tesla killer, Faraday’s meteoric rise in notoriety occurred on dubious underpinnings — the company did not promise a product, nor did it announce any concrete plans for its first few years of operation. The mystery surrounding Faraday was only matched by its enigmatic cofounder and CEO, Jia YT Yueting, the billionaire businessman who founded multiple telecom companies in China but left abruptly to become the CEO of Faraday. We took a look at YT and Faraday Future's promise, the financial woes that led them both to bankruptcy, and YT's relationship with the reanimated Faraday today.MORE CARS INSIDER:The Rise And Fall Of Hummerhttps://youtu.be/SHLmoswkkAQTesla Tuning Shop Upgrades Model X Into A $175,000 Masterpiecehttps://youtu.be/r3kvjBFLXz8Why Tesla's Model 3 Received A 5-Star Crash Test Ratinghttps://youtu.be/il2jmMRgFV8------------------------------------------------------#FaradayFuture #ElectricCar #BusinessInsiderBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.Visit us at: https://www.businessinsider.comSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsiderBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcjBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29TBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGFBI on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo--------------------------------------------------How The Man Who Challenged Tesla Went Bankrupt"

Rick Shiels heads to the Quest Golf Academy to test the drivers and see if they do actually hit the golf ball longer, hit the golf ball straight and help swing the golf club faster. Rick tests the driver using Titleist PRO V1 golf balls and Foresight GC Quad. Rick then takes the Callaway Mavrik Driver on the course against the Callaway Epic Flash Driver from 2019 to see if the claim of gaining 5 more yards is actually true. The Callaway Mavrik Driver, Callaway Mavrik Subzero Driver and Callaway Mavrik Max Driver will be played by golfers on The European Tour, The PGA Tour as well as The Masters, The USPGA, The US Open and The Open. Some of the best golfers in the world such as Phil Mickelson, Xander Schauffelle, Danny Willett, Francesco Molinari and Henrik Stenson will be using the new drivers BUT are they actually any better than the Callaway Epic Flash?

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video."

Today I'm going to be customizing 3 different iphone cases. I'm painting on phone cases with acrylic paint, using some different styles and techniques including abstract design and semi-realism. Hope you like rainbows, cute animals (or demon animals), fruit and desserts!It's been a trend recently to paint directly on the iphone, but I think I'm going to stick with the cases for now 😂 I really want to learn more about how to customize different items and how to make painted surfaces more practical for everyday use. So if any of you have any knowledge of what kind of techniques or products I can use to prep different painting surfaces, please let me know!Also, if you guys really love any of the phone case designs, I could work on getting the design printed on actual phone cases to put in my shop!
