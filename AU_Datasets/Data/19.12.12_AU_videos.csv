Jordan, Jamie Foxx, and Brie Larson star in #JustMercy, in cinemas January 23, 2020. Michael B. Jordan (“Black Panther,” “Creed,” “Creed II”) and Oscar winners Jamie Foxx(“Ray,” “Baby Driver,” “Django: Unchained”) and Brie Larson (“Room,” “The Glass Castle,” “CaptainMarvel”) star in “Just Mercy,” an inspiring drama that brings one of the most important stories ofour time to the big screen.Award-winning filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton (“The Glass Castle,” “Short Term 12”)directed the film from a screenplay he co-wrote, based on the award-winning nonfiction bestsellerby Bryan Stevenson.A powerful and thought-provoking true story, “Just Mercy” follows young lawyer BryanStevenson (Jordan) and his history-making battle for justice. After graduating from Harvard, Bryanhad his pick of lucrative jobs. Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemnedor who were not afforded proper representation, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley(Larson). One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite apreponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony againsthim came from a criminal with a motive to lie. In the years that follow, Bryan becomes embroiledin a labyrinth of legal and political maneuverings and overt and unabashed racism as he fights forWalter, and others like him, with the odds—and the system—stacked against them.The main cast also includes Rob Morgan (“Mudbound”) as Herbert Richardson, a fellowprisoner who also sits on death row awaiting his fate; Tim Blake Nelson (“Wormwood”) as RalphMyers, whose pivotal testimony against Walter McMillian is called into question; Rafe Spall asTommy Chapman, the DA who is fighting to uphold Walter’s conviction and sentence; O’SheaJackson Jr. (“Straight Outta Compton”) as Anthony Ray Hinton, another wrongly convicted deathrow inmate whose cause is taken up by Bryan; and Karan Kendrick (“The Hate U Give”) as Walter’swife, Minnie McMillian, who stands by her husband.The film is produced by two-time Oscar nominee Gil Netter (“Life of Pi,” “The Blind Side”),Asher Goldstein (“Short Term 12”) and Michael B. Jordan. Bryan Stevenson, Mike Drake, Niija Kuykendall, Gabriel Hammond, Daniel Hammond, Scott Budnick, Jeff Skoll and Charles D. Kingserved as executive producers.Cretton co-wrote the screenplay with Andrew Lanham (“The Glass Castle”), based onStevenson’s book Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption. Published in 2014 by Spiegel &Grau, the book has spent more than 150 weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers List, andcounting. It was also named one of the year’s best books by a number of top publications,including TIME Magazine. For the book, Stevenson also won the Andrew Carnegie Medal forExcellence, an NAACP Image Award, and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Nonfiction.Cretton’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Brett Pawlak,production designer Sharon Seymour, editor Nat Sanders and composer Joel P. West, all of whompreviously collaborated with the director on “The Glass Castle.” They are joined by costumedesigner Francine Jamison-Tanchuck (“Detroit,” “Roman J. Israel, Esq.”).Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in Association with Endeavor Content/OneCommunity/Participant Media/Macro, a Gil Netter Production, an Outlier Society Production, “JustMercy.” Slated for release on January 23, 2020, “Just Mercy” will be distributedworldwide by Warner Bros.

What truths about the past await Elsa as she ventures into the unknown to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond Arendelle? The answers are calling her but also threatening her kingdom. Together with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven, she'll face a dangerous but remarkable journey. In “Frozen,” Elsa feared her powers were too much for the world. In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough.

We finally got ourselves some project cars, Nissan 350Zs to be exact … well two of them. A few months ago we filmed a brand new show called HiLow! The objective was to build one 350Z with cheap parts and the other 350Z with top-of-the-line expensive parts. The journey was probably the most fun we’ve had at Donut, and the final results were very interesting. HiLow drops tomorrow on YouTube, but in the meantime, we're giving you a sneak peek and going Bumper 2 Bumper on our very own Nissan 350Zs!

I started by using a brick mold made of fired clay from a previous video and made bricks from clay. The bricks were allowed to dry and were then transported to my hut using a brick carrying harness I made from cane and a piece of wood. They were dry stacked onto the wall of the hut to keep them out of the rain while waiting to be fired. I then constructed a brick kiln using mud as a mortar for adhering the bricks together. The kiln had 2 fireboxes side by side and was of the updraft kiln type. The kiln was open at the front and back so it could be stoked from these areas. This gave a more consistent firing I found then a kiln only with firebox opening at the front. I put 40 un-fired bricks into the kiln and fired them for 2 hours 30 minutes. All the bricks were fired sufficiently. I then tested an un-fired brick and a fired one by putting them in water. The un-fired brick dissolved quickly while the fired one survived completely intact. The test was a success. My only issue is the bricks are a little weak due to the clay they're made of. I'll look at refining clay or finding a better source somewhere in this area. About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
