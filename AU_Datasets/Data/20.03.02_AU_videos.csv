Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend, Samantha VincentNo matter how fast you are, no one outruns their past. Summer 2020 is the time for F9, the ninth chapter in the saga that has endured for almost two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  Vin Diesel‚Äôs Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he‚Äôs going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they‚Äôve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom‚Äôs forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, next year‚Äôs The Suicide Squad). F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe‚Äîfrom London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tblisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom‚Äôs past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent."

To save 20%, enter MORIAH at checkout ‚Äì‚Äìhttp://bit.ly/HUM_moriahSo today is a weird video. I've had this video planned for SUCH a long time LOL. I bought the book back in June, and I've been waiting for just the right occasion. Also, I needed time to collect the hair off my cat haha. I ended up not needed that much...I have quite a bit of fur left over. So if anyone needs a buttload of coffee colored cat hair, I gotcha covered üòÇ I did have fun making this very weird cat themed craft. It's been awhile since I've straight-up crafted at all, so I guess making cat finger puppets was the perfect way to come back? If you're ever bored and want to make some unique crafts with supplies you have at home (if you have a cat), then I recommend trying this. Then give away your cat hair projects as gifts...your family and friends will loooove them and definitely not be weirded out at all. üòù THIS IS THE LAST DAY TO ORDER PICKLE THE DINOSAUR. He is an exclusive collector's item and will be very rare and difficult to find after today.ORDER HERE: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/SimplyNailogical's Cat Hair Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hKjVRYmrRkIn case you want to craft with your own cat:The Crafting With Cat Hair Book: https://amzn.to/2uNF2gW*affiliate link*___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously.

I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Sockie's wish has one chance of coming true. Sockie's dream is to meet Gordon Ramsay. Gordon Ramsay is in Australia on a business trip and has decided to donate a prize to raise money for the Australian Bushfires. Whoever bids the most will win a lunch meal with Gordon Ramsay. It's Sockie Norris' only chance to make her dream come true and in this video we see what happens inside the Norris Nuts family as they decide how to approach this amazing once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. There will be an auction for the prize to have a dinner with Gordon Ramsay. The Norris Nuts decide if they are going to bid for Sockie and how much money to bid as it will all be donated to a great cause to help families in Australia who have lost their homes in the Australian bush fires in 2020.

But we all need to get our head on straight around this fast-spreading viral outbreak.A pandemic is #3 on my personal ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù list (a prolonged grid-down event is #2, and a global world war with nukes is, by far, #1)Once a pandemic spreads to my neck of the woods, I‚Äôm not going to be doing anything in the company of strangers.  No shopping, no going to restaurants, and especially no traveling in closed up metal tubes with recirculated air (i.e. planes and trains).I won‚Äôt be alone in those behaviors.  How many airline pilots, train conductors, trash collectors, and medical personnel have to call in ‚Äúsick‚Äù to disrupt the entire system?  Not that many.So why is this Wuhan New Coronavirus (officially ‚Äú2019-ncov‚Äù) a substantially more dangerous threat than the standard flu?"

Does more expensive mean more better? We‚Äôre gonna find out once and for all.Donut bought two identical Nissan 350z‚Äôs, and for the past few weeks have been modifying them to be FUN, daily drivers that you can take to the track.Team Low (Nolan Sykes & Aaron Parker) got a bunch of really cheap parts and in the end got  a slammed turbo z that shoots flames all for around $13,000.Team Hi (James Pumphrey & Zach Jobe) on the other hand, got a bunch of really nice expensive stuff totaling an astounding $33,000.  Then we tested them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. We‚Äôre gonna break down the cost of building these two cars, test them head to head on track, and decide which is better. Low Car got a set of eBay coilovers of unknown origin,  and Hi Car was treated to a set of KW V3s. Next, we installed wheels and tires. Hi Car got some sick Advan RGIII‚Äôs wrapped in Bridgestone RE71s. Meanwhile on the Low Car, We bought some XXR 527s, and decided to run Federal RS-RR tires. In the end, both cars were able to achieve supercar-level braking distance by switching to super sticky rubber. Nolan and Aaron installed more aggressive brake pads, steel braided brake lines, flushed and replaced the brake fluid, and bled the lines. Over on Hi Car, Zach and James replaced the car‚Äôs entire braking system with a 6 piston, 13 brake kit from Wilwood. After that we went inside our Zs, installing racing seats. The Hi Car got two Sparco QRT-R seats, a Greddy steering wheel, and a hub to make it removable. Lo Car received some Corbeau DFXs racing seats.Next, both cars were fitted with modified differentials to make sick skids easier. Hi Car got a very trick Kaaz 2-way differential. Zach spent a lot of time adjusting the spacing, making sure it was perfect. Over on Lo Car we took a different route. Instead of installing a new differential, we welded ours together!After making a bunch of performance upgrades, it was time to alter the looks of our beloved Zs. Team Low decided to give Lo Car some plastidip.Over on team Hi, they took their car to a professional vinyl shop.Finally, we gave the Donut Zs some BOOST! Hi car got a Jim Wolf  twin turbo setup that made it sound like a Baby GTR. And the low car got a single turbo kit by way of eBay.Check out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHUSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!‚ñ∫Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvOLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/Click here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/Donut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.
