The amount of support I've received on a daily basis whether it be on social media, emails or even in person has been very overwhelming, even still to this day. This along with my love of photography has been my life's work, but recently all of that has come to a halt due to a defamation claim against myself.Due to these circumstances, I am unable to work or function because of an ongoing court proceeding. I also suffer from mental illnesses which ultimately effects my mindset, surroundings, way of living and method of income. For obvious legal reasons, I am unable to disclose any further information as much as I'd love to, however it will all be explained in due time.As my last resort I've had to make a go fund me to support my cause. In no way shape or form do I expect you to go out of your way to assist me you've all done enough just by being here.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance.

I'm back with another episode of squishy makeovers. This is a good one! I made some creations, I'm really proud of, I hope you guys like them just as much as I do.Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

On, Prancer and Vixen!On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen!To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.So up to the roof-top the coursers they flew,With the sleigh full of toys, and St Nicholas too.And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.As I drew in my head, and was turning around,Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.He was dressed all in furs, from his head to his foot,And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.His eyes-how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow,And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.He had a broad face and a little round belly,That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,And he filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.And laying his finger to the side of his nose,And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.But I heard him exclaim, ‘as he drove out of sight,Merry Christmas to all, and to all, good-night!Read AloudReadingClement Clarke MooreBeing ReadChristmas Poem'Twas The Night Before Christmas - Narrated by Michael Bublé"

After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy’s top aviators, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: “Rooster,” the son of Maverick’s late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka “Goose.” Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.

This year was so disconnected from that concept, more a top ten list than a recap of our platform's milestones. Why though? Why has this become YouTube's new norm - and yes, this is now the norm.
