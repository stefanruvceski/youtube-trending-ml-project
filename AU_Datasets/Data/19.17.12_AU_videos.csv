After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy’s top aviators, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: “Rooster,” the son of Maverick’s late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka “Goose.” Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.

Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. This led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   But the big picture conceals  the details. Let us look at one region in particular: Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. So is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?

Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLPWhat causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.Special thanks to:Professor David Sinclair, check out his book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have ToAssistant Professor David GoldNoemie Sierra (for polyp images)Genepool Productions for telomere animations from Immortal: https://ve42.co/immortalEpigenetics animations (DNA, histones, methylation etc) courtesy of: http://wehi.tvAnimation: Etsuko UnoArt and Technical Direction: Drew BerrySound Design: Francois Tetaz & Emma BortignonScientific Consultation: Marnie BlewittCourtesy of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical ResearchFilming, editing and animation by Jonny Hyman and Derek MullerMusic from https://epidemicsound.com Clearer Views Innovations A Sound Foundation SeaweedAdditional music by Kevin MacLeod from https://incompetech.com Marty Gots a Plan"

Jordan, Jamie Foxx, and Brie Larson star in #JustMercy, in cinemas January 23, 2020. Michael B. Jordan (“Black Panther,” “Creed,” “Creed II”) and Oscar winners Jamie Foxx(“Ray,” “Baby Driver,” “Django: Unchained”) and Brie Larson (“Room,” “The Glass Castle,” “CaptainMarvel”) star in “Just Mercy,” an inspiring drama that brings one of the most important stories ofour time to the big screen.Award-winning filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton (“The Glass Castle,” “Short Term 12”)directed the film from a screenplay he co-wrote, based on the award-winning nonfiction bestsellerby Bryan Stevenson.A powerful and thought-provoking true story, “Just Mercy” follows young lawyer BryanStevenson (Jordan) and his history-making battle for justice. After graduating from Harvard, Bryanhad his pick of lucrative jobs. Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemnedor who were not afforded proper representation, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley(Larson). One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite apreponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony againsthim came from a criminal with a motive to lie. In the years that follow, Bryan becomes embroiledin a labyrinth of legal and political maneuverings and overt and unabashed racism as he fights forWalter, and others like him, with the odds—and the system—stacked against them.The main cast also includes Rob Morgan (“Mudbound”) as Herbert Richardson, a fellowprisoner who also sits on death row awaiting his fate; Tim Blake Nelson (“Wormwood”) as RalphMyers, whose pivotal testimony against Walter McMillian is called into question; Rafe Spall asTommy Chapman, the DA who is fighting to uphold Walter’s conviction and sentence; O’SheaJackson Jr. (“Straight Outta Compton”) as Anthony Ray Hinton, another wrongly convicted deathrow inmate whose cause is taken up by Bryan; and Karan Kendrick (“The Hate U Give”) as Walter’swife, Minnie McMillian, who stands by her husband.The film is produced by two-time Oscar nominee Gil Netter (“Life of Pi,” “The Blind Side”),Asher Goldstein (“Short Term 12”) and Michael B. Jordan. Bryan Stevenson, Mike Drake, Niija Kuykendall, Gabriel Hammond, Daniel Hammond, Scott Budnick, Jeff Skoll and Charles D. Kingserved as executive producers.Cretton co-wrote the screenplay with Andrew Lanham (“The Glass Castle”), based onStevenson’s book Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption. Published in 2014 by Spiegel &Grau, the book has spent more than 150 weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers List, andcounting. It was also named one of the year’s best books by a number of top publications,including TIME Magazine. For the book, Stevenson also won the Andrew Carnegie Medal forExcellence, an NAACP Image Award, and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Nonfiction.Cretton’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Brett Pawlak,production designer Sharon Seymour, editor Nat Sanders and composer Joel P. West, all of whompreviously collaborated with the director on “The Glass Castle.” They are joined by costumedesigner Francine Jamison-Tanchuck (“Detroit,” “Roman J. Israel, Esq.”).Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in Association with Endeavor Content/OneCommunity/Participant Media/Macro, a Gil Netter Production, an Outlier Society Production, “JustMercy.” Slated for release on January 23, 2020, “Just Mercy” will be distributedworldwide by Warner Bros.
