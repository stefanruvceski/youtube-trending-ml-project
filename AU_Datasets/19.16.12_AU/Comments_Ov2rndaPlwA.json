He was the nicest guy ever, he gave gifts, and money to charity for kids that can't aford toys, he's the saintiest saint of all saints. He was also a priest. My theory is that when he died God brought him back to life so people that weren't Christians could still celebrate Jesus's birth without knowing it, and that the guys who came up with it actually got it from a dream meeting with him. there's actually evidence that suports this theory. Nick[nickolous] loved giving gifts to kids, so maybe God blessed him so he could do what he loved. Also the guys came up with it AFTER he died! Sure this evidence is circumstantial, but I think we both know it would make a great theory. But hey, that's just a theory... a film theory!", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-16T21:46:47.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-16T21:46:47.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/tIcnuxWzLnDv3hNyTdu6TQb8yro\"", "id": "Ugxn77xPH_hng_9JLhZ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "Ov2rndaPlwA", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/6uPlIPO9sfMi8M9iIX-PXINXidI\"", "id": "Ugxn77xPH_hng_9JLhZ4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Fusrodog", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-JlVk9bT4W9XnWlu7pWF9mGxG4pSkvAtlLXw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq5r53REDat-MxJmKyJGRew", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCq5r53REDat-MxJmKyJGRew"}, "videoId": "Ov2rndaPlwA", "textDisplay": "Everyone&#39;s talking about wishing for more wishes and all I&#39;m thinking is him wishing to be the strongest thing in the multiverse.", "textOriginal": "Everyone's talking about wishing for more wishes and all I'm thinking is him wishing to be the strongest thing in the multiverse.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2019-12-16T21:45:33.000Z", "updatedAt": "2019-12-16T21:45:33.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/SeXs_s-_w25rbc8orgBT7lHIz_c\"", "id": "UgwQi6qVAHLNQ1vX8Np4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "Ov2rndaPlwA", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"p4VTdlkQv3HQeTEaXgvLePAydmU/qlkPClErnTFAVsNghum-m5IH5Vs\"", "id": "UgwQi6qVAHLNQ1vX8Np4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "PrissyNeko", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-h0qoYnzjJHugqTUO5dwkxUyA-krjEDpWTcA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9YawGwh_Feuif5n23Hvmcw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9YawGwh_Feuif5n23Hvmcw"}, "videoId": "Ov2rndaPlwA", "textDisplay": "There had always been female rulers throughout history.
