They are very cautious about what to prescribe. I hope no one misreads into those words Lady Gaga spoke and that anyone else in a situation like mine does not feel discouraged to seek help.

My antidepressant is prescribed by my primary care doctor BUT I'm also seeing a therapist to help work on my depression. Usually in France, a consult with a primary care doctor is not long enough to actually work on the issues of the depressed patients. And, without therapy, why prescribe antidepressant? Just so that the person doesn\"t drown in her depression? That's great, and of course if it's a moderate to intense depression phase, it has to be done. However, in the majority of patients, medication alone isn't enough to overcome depression or prevent a relapse in the long term. \nDepression is a bit like if you were drowning in the ocean in too for from the shore. Antidepressants are a lifevest, but it is with therapy that you are going to be able to learn how to swimm back to safety. \n\nI know that the healthcare system in broken in a lot of countries, and that psychiatrists are overwhelmed...
