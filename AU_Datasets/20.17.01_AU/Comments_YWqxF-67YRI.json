You remind me of my boyfriend (not because of how you look but because of your attitude, colorblindness and so on) so much that it actually hurt a lot. He has dealt with depression since before I knew him but has made the decision to do something about it this year.\nHowever, I also started sobbing because you have been an important part of my life. I know it sounds weird but seeing your videos and listening to the PMA always brought a smile to my face, even when I personally wasn't feeling too well. So, hearing you admit that there was a time when you were wondering if anyone would even miss you if you were gone was kind of heartbreaking to me.\nWe love you Se\u00e0n and we are proud of you for being able to take your life back together even if it doesn't feel like you have done it entirely. Thank you for being honest. \ud83d\udc99", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2020-01-17T17:43:52.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-17T17:43:52.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 1, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/qzOkUvS5-Nwg12zRYg_SnMgFPls\"", "id": "UgxylhxhYZAfMwn9sHl4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "YWqxF-67YRI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/Ih2PG6QR7PbvauT2DOEAu0xw4vM\"", "id": "UgxylhxhYZAfMwn9sHl4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Lewis Shanks", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_jFni6YgkZpM900XHq93j2iVD6gX--DmhdCw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5n1eVu7doUlNzJOmVBYF1A", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5n1eVu7doUlNzJOmVBYF1A"}, "videoId": "YWqxF-67YRI", "textDisplay": "Why is the category comedy", "textOriginal": "Why is the category comedy", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-17T17:36:03.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-17T17:36:03.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 1, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/H2bLhdOzw_U_83u56buGPr4Own0\"", "id": "UgzCutrH93h56hEj11J4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "YWqxF-67YRI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/jAJRD5mjaW8K71otCDHcCC2bYyM\"", "id": "UgzCutrH93h56hEj11J4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Heyden Jaye", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l79IoK0z7C3KA54CW4GNL0Th86r_uF71fhLZYg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4CE084ERDmYUlr7ruOuPyA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4CE084ERDmYUlr7ruOuPyA"}, "videoId": "YWqxF-67YRI", "textDisplay": "My brother passed away in November 2017, seemingly out of nowhere.<br /><br /><br />Thank you for staying around, Sean.", "textOriginal": "My brother passed away in November 2017, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\n\nThank you for staying around, Sean.", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-17T17:28:53.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-17T17:28:53.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/CzgDd3flFUy9nSYtW3JhNQGZE3I\"", "id": "Ugy8rG-AnpFYmJJ0rIV4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "YWqxF-67YRI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/4wGQEjXtwdewFpSESvG-Ln_Jwvg\"", "id": "Ugy8rG-AnpFYmJJ0rIV4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "UltraSoulHero", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7-gWIJmeM6ZGrmaRCz2l-pmv80YXBoT0Pw82g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3-OEHtPktjpKVtsYYYn4w", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCn3-OEHtPktjpKVtsYYYn4w"}, "videoId": "YWqxF-67YRI", "textDisplay": "Hey Jack i found your channel when you were playing Subnautica,Outer Wilds. if you don&#39;t have any plans for games to play maybe you would make more Subnautica Bellow zero videos or continue your Outer Wilds videos?", "textOriginal": "Hey Jack i found your channel when you were playing Subnautica,Outer Wilds. if you don't have any plans for games to play maybe you would make more Subnautica Bellow zero videos or continue your Outer Wilds videos?", "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2020-01-17T17:27:47.000Z", "updatedAt": "2020-01-17T17:27:47.000Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/s5BaDscgXhng8G8JnehcOqH8U50\"", "id": "UgziCCg_SomKml2ry0l4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "YWqxF-67YRI", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/qJK_znbL0jZakx82WDuFPQ_NU3c\"", "id": "UgziCCg_SomKml2ry0l4AaABAg", "snippet": {"authorDisplayName": "Nestalia Art", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l793fACic1dpR-AoMiOL4Lw9WLWRqu4YuMSE-w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYCMwrsTRInpvS2pcrlS_bQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYCMwrsTRInpvS2pcrlS_bQ"}, "videoId": "YWqxF-67YRI", "textDisplay": "Just wanted to share, its not a happy story but I need to get it out.
